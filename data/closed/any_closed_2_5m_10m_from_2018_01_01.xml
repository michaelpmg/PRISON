    <title>Yemen - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis, even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. There are currently 22.2 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance, including 11.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. Yemen is experiencing the world's largest man-made food security crisis, with over sixty percent of the population (17.8 million) currently food insecure and 8.4 million people relying on food assistance to survive. Malnutrition has soared by over 65% in 2017, and an estimated 400,000 children under five years of age are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. More than three million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. Yemen is also afflicted by one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded with over 1 million suspected cases and 2,300 deaths reported since 27 April 2017. Many health facilities have been destroyed or have stopped functioning. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Community Policing in Liberated Areas of Iraq</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the capacity of local police and civil society to work together to address security issues in Ninewah and Anbar, Iraq through the use of community policing practices.  Police forces are currently supporting other Iraqi Security Forces in their fight against Daesh; however as the latter loses ground there is a need for local police forces to provide security as a service to the populace in areas liberated from Daesh.  Project activities include: (1) training local police and civil society on community policing; (2) establishing community police forums; (3) rehabilitating police stations;  and (4) assessing the security needs of local women and youth in targeted areas.</description>

    <title>Achieving Reproductive Rights for Adolescents, Reducing Maternal and Newborn Mortality</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of adolescent girls and women and reduce maternal and newborn mortality among vulnerable populations in Bolivia. This is achieved through a rights-based approach that is adolescent-friendly and culturally sensitive. The project addresses barriers to adolescents’ demand for reproductive and sexual health services, challenges in providing such services, and community and institutional level governance and accountability. Plan Canada implements the project in 12 municipalities in the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potosí.</description>

    <title>Victoria International Development Education Association - IAYI Internships 2018-2023</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Aboriginal Youth Internships (IAYI) initiative. The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  As part of the Walking Together: Futures for Youth project, the Victoria International Development Education Association (VIDEA), in partnership with the T'Sou-ke Nation, sends 140 Indigenous youth to three different countries. Interns develop meaningful and manageable skills, and experience in the areas of information and communications, organic and conservation agriculture, traditional crafting, community development, youth development, event organization, administration and finance, early childhood and primary education, sports and recreation, and trades.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Community Protection Systems for Children and Youth in Kinshasa</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the well-being of children and youth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through the prevention of violence against children and youth, and the improvement of services for street children and at-risk families in five communes in Kinshasa. To do so, the project supports outreach activities and programs that focus on improving services offered at protection and health centres, taking into account the particular needs of girls and boys. The project also seeks to improve key public policies for child protection and strengthen respect of their rights. The project uses mechanisms such as inclusive consultation committees to allow children and youth to actively participate in, and influence, the decisions that affect them and the type of services available to them.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include : (1) local institutions are more effective at preventing violence and protecting children and youth, taking into account gender-based differences; (2) families and communities adopt gender-equitable practices that better respect the rights of children and youth; and (3) increased participation of children and youth in gender-specific and equitable violence prevention and protection activities and services.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2021) include: (1) 19 shelters (of which 8 are for girls, 9 are for boys and 2 are mixed) were fit up; (2) 1,717 children and youths living on the street (634 girls and 1,083 boys) were reunited with their families; (3) 35,727 children and youths (20,051 girls and 15,676 boys) were educated about sexual and reproductive health; (4) 16 local communities in Kinshasa and 6 local child protection committees were strengthened; (5) the violence prevention skills of 4,218 families were expanded; and (6) 596 peer educators (299 girls and 297 boys) were educated about issues that concern them, such as sexual and reproductive health, children’s rights, substance abuse, and sexual and gender-based violence. As a result, they have the knowledge they need so they can, in turn, educate children and youths living on the street.  The project made it possible to fully care for 14,724 children living on the street (5,642 girls and 9,082 boys), or 147% of the initial goal of 10,000 children.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Nigeria - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Assistance - Action Against Hunger 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 – The conflict between Boko Haram and Nigerian armed forces has devastated communities in north-eastern Nigeria. It is estimated that 10.2 million people will require humanitarian assistance in order to survive in 2018, of which 85% are women and children. As the conflict evolves, humanitarian access remains a challenge. Assistance for basic survival, basic services and protection is vital for displaced populations, host communities and vulnerable people across the north-east.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger is helping to assist up to 99,200 conflict-affected people in Borno and Yobe states. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating or constructing up to 34 water points benefiting up to 34,000 people; (2) sensitizing communities on the Community-Led Total Sanitation approach that mobilizes communities to eliminate open defecation with a specific focus on women and girls, benefiting up to 77,000 people; and (3) providing latrines and water supplies within 72 hours of onset of emergency, benefiting up to 5,246 people.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Hygiene and Livelihoods Assistance - Islamic Relief Canada 2018-19</title>
    <description>May 2018 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis according to the United Nations, with 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 11.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. Sixty percent of the population (17.8 million people) is food insecure, with 8.4 million people on the brink of famine. Malnutrition has soared by over 65% in 2017, and an estimated 400,000 children under five years of age are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. Yemen is currently facing a diphtheria outbreak with over 1,500 suspected cases, and could face another wave of cholera with the beginning of its rainy season in April. In 2017, it was afflicted by one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with over 1 million suspected cases and 2,200 deaths reported. Many health facilities have been destroyed or have stopped functioning. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s multi-year support, Islamic Relief Canada is providing emergency water, hygiene, and livelihoods support to up to 59,500 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Dhamar and Al Dhale governorates of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water sources; (2) promoting hygiene awareness and distributing hygiene kits; (3) rehabilitating community assets through a cash-for-work approach; and (4) providing agricultural inputs to vulnerable farmers.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Livelihoods Assistance - Mercy Corps 2018-19</title>
    <description>May 2018 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis according to the United Nations, with 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 11.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. Sixty percent of the population (17.8 million people) is food insecure, with 8.4 million people on the brink of famine. Malnutrition has soared by over 65% in 2017, and an estimated 400,000 children under five years of age are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. Yemen is currently facing a diphtheria outbreak with over 1,500 suspected cases, and could face another wave of cholera with the beginning of its rainy season in April. In 2017, it was afflicted by one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with over 1 million suspected cases and 2,200 deaths reported. Many health facilities have been destroyed or have stopped functioning. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s multi-year support, Mercy Corps is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene and livelihoods support to up to 329,400 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Lahj and Al Dhale governorates of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating critical water and sanitation systems and infrastructure; (2) promoting hygiene awareness in affected communities; and (3) providing cash assistance to vulnerable households to meet their basic needs.</description>

    <title>Sahel – Nutrition, Health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Assistance – Action Against Hunger 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 - Conditions across the Sahel belt and neighbouring countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have deteriorated, resulting in a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by a range of factors including poverty, political and economic instability, conflict, and climate change. The current conditions with respect to rainfall resemble those seen in 2011-2012, when drought and crop production shortfalls caused a major food crisis. The drought situation is expected to result in intensified food insecurity and increased humanitarian needs throughout 2018 and into the next year.  With the support of GAC, Action Against Hunger is helping to assist up to 1,467,170 affected people in eight Sahel and neighbouring countries: Mauritania, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, Nigeria and Cameroon. Project activities include: (1) supporting the treatment of severe acute malnutrition cases with or without serious medical complications for children affected by severe acute malnutrition; (2) setting up strategies to promote good food practices and behaviors, taking into account the beneficiaries’ socio-economic and cultural background; (3) reinforcing the capacity of community actors on pregnancy monitoring, danger signs detection and assisted childbirth; (4) rehabilitating, putting in place and ensuring follow-up on the water, sanitation and hygiene minimal package in health and community structures; and (5) reinforcing the decision-making power of women in the prevention of severe acute malnutrition through sensitization sessions and nutritious local food vouchers.</description>

    <title>Nigeria - Nutrition and Protection Assistance - Save the Children Canada 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 – The conflict between Boko Haram and Nigerian armed forces has devastated communities in north-eastern Nigeria. It is estimated that 10.2 million people will require humanitarian assistance in order to survive in 2018, of which 85% are women and children. As the conflict evolves, humanitarian access remains a challenge. Assistance for basic survival, basic services and protection is vital for displaced populations, host communities and vulnerable people across the north-east.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is helping to assist more than 109,000 conflict-affected people in Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing treatment to children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition and diseases that exacerbate malnutrition, benefiting more than 28,000 children; (2) providing hygiene promotion activities, with a focus on improving nutrition outcomes, benefiting more than 102,000 people; (3) providing psychosocial support and life skills training to girls and boys aged 3-17, benefiting up to 7,060 people; and (4) providing case management, response services and referrals to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, unaccompanied and separated children, children associated with armed forces and armed groups, adolescent heads of household and other at-risk girls and boys, benefiting up to 9,050 people.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Health and Nutrition Assistance - ADRA Canada 2018-2019</title>
    <description>May 2018 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis according to the United Nations, with 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 11.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. Sixty percent of the population (17.8 million people) is food insecure, with 8.4 million people on the brink of famine. Malnutrition has soared by over 65% in 2017, and an estimated 400,000 children under five years of age are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. Yemen is currently facing a diphtheria outbreak with over 1,500 suspected cases, and could face another wave of cholera with the beginning of its rainy season in April. In 2017, it was afflicted by one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with over 1 million suspected cases and 2,200 deaths reported. Many health facilities have been destroyed or have stopped functioning. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s multi-year support, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) Canada is providing emergency health and nutrition support to up to 213,800 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Marib governorate of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing health facilities with essential medication and medical supplies; (2) providing sexual and reproductive health services, including emergency obstetric and newborn care; (3) providing medical services and psychosocial support to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; and (4) screening and providing treatment for acute malnutrition, particularly among children and pregnant and lactating women.</description>

    <title>Uganda - Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees - CLWR  2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, more than 1.4 million, with roughly two thirds of them having arrived from South Sudan since July 2016. This large and rapid influx has strained the humanitarian response capacity in northern Uganda to near breaking. New refugee settlements almost immediately reach full capacity, while service providers struggle to meet the most basic needs of the community. Overall, South Sudanese make up more than three quarters of the refugee population in Uganda (more than 1 million people).  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Lutheran World Relief (CLWR) is providing healthcare (including sexual and reproductive health), water and sanitation, protection, and livelihoods opportunities to an estimated 40,000 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Lamwo and Moyo districts of Uganda. Project activities include: (1) providing training, equipment and supplies to local health facilities; (2) constructing or rehabilitating  household and institutional sanitation facilities; (3) awareness raising campaigns to combat sexual and gender-based violence; and (4) supporting village savings and loans associations and livelihoods training.</description>

    <title>Institutional Support to the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala - 2018-2019</title>
    <description>This grant is Canada’s long-term institutional support to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s multi-donor trust fund in support of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). It contributes to increasing the rule of law, thereby reducing impunity and improving access to rights, especially for women and Indigenous communities. To do so, CICIG seeks to strengthen Guatemala’s capacity to conduct gender-sensitive criminal investigations, prosecute State infiltrated organized crime, and propose judicial and institutional reforms.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) strengthened State institutions responsible for the gender-sensitive criminal investigation and prosecution of organized criminal networks involved in corruption and other crimes that undermine the rule of law and security - including those against women and girls; and (2) improved justice sector gender-sensitive response mechanisms to reduce impunity.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved by the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) through the support of the Government of Canada and other international donors, until March 2019 include:  (1) criminal investigations of 107 members of twelve criminal structures, including 88 men and 19 women, that culminated in formal accusations by CICIG and the Guatemalan Public Ministry . The cases presented before the Guatemalan courts focussed on corruption in health, transport, the military industry, municipalities, congress, and the justice system, as well as illicit electoral financing and extrajudicial killings and torture; and (2) CICIG developed technical proposals for criminal code reform on reduced penalties for accepting charges, and on reducing the use of preventative detention. CICIG also worked with civil society to propose criminal code reforms on human and sex trafficking.  Results achieved through the Government of Canada’s continuous support to CICIG, together with the Guatemalan Public Ministry, over more than 11 years through four projects, include: (1) identified and dismantled over 60 criminal structures linked to the State; (2) presented 34 legal reforms to strengthen the Guatemalan justice system; (3) put forward more than 100 criminal accusations against organized crime groups; processed more than 680 people and achieved 310 convictions; (4) CICIG has maintained a 70% citizen approval rate over its lifetime and is strongly supported by civil society organizations including women's, Indigenous, LGBTI, human rights and justice organizations; and (5) CICIG has installed new investigative capacities in the Public Ministry and provided technical assistance to other State dependencies such as the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Ministries of Health, Education, Interior, the Judicial Organism and the National Tax Authority.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Sexual Violence Prevention in Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce sexual violence in Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan. The goal is to deliver the Empowerment Transformation Training (ETT) Program, which is a successful and rigorously tested rape prevention approach that targets female and male youths in schools and community-based organizations. Project activities include: (1) a needs assessment and curriculum development for South Sudan and Somalia; (2) capacity building for training of trainers; (3) monitoring and evaluation; and (4) ETT curriculum delivery to over 25,000 girls and boys, and young women and men (ages 10-22) in designated schools, community-based organizations, churches and mosques.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved effectiveness of programs and their consistent administration to help prevent sexual and gender-based violence and radicalization; and (2) strengthened community response to sexual violence, negative gender stereotypes and radicalization in schools, camps and other high risk areas.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved include: (1) the successful design of a randomized control trial in Kenya, Somalia, and South Sudan; (2) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) prevention methods have undergone a randomized control trial to test their effectiveness to reduce SGBV in Fragile and Conflict Affected States (FCAS); (3) a baseline was established for key indicators in Kenya, Somalia, and South Sudan to help assess the effectiveness of these prevention methods; (4) in South Sudan, the partner adapted their school-based training to develop a community-based approach curriculum. This comes as a response to the growing need to prevent SGBV in the community at large; (5) 113 school teachers were trained in Empowerment Transformation Training (ETT) SGBV prevention in South Sudan; (6) 53,595 boys and girls received ETT on SGBV prevention; and (7) over 12,000 of these beneficiaries are voluntarily participating in the multi-county randomized control trial to better inform a broader community of practice about what works to prevent SGBV in FCAS.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of poor and socially excluded people, or people living in underserved areas, especially women, girls and youth, in Mali, Malawi, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala. It seeks to improve access to quality sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and strengthen governments’ support in these countries.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the ability of International Planned Parenthood Federation’s member associations’ to provide a full range of integrated SRH services and to disseminate information about these services; and (2) increasing the ability of civil society organizations to hold governments to account for their SRH services and related spending commitments, and to build public support for SRHR.  An estimated 10.4 million people are expected to benefit from sexual and reproductive health services, which is expected to contribute to averting 1.5 million unintended pregnancies.</description>

    <title>Scaling Her Voice on Air in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali and Senegal</title>
    <description>A fundamental rural development need in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali and Senegal is the lack of relevant, gender-responsive and timely information, communication and extension services for small-scale farmers (women, men and youth). To address this issue, Farm Radio International (FRI) aims to scale up interactive rural radio in 17 regions of Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal and Ghana, reaching 61 radio stations and engaging at least 70 stakeholder groups including farmer-based and women’s organizations. Project activities include: (1) providing relevant, timely and gender-responsive information on: effective, climate-smart agriculture; climate adaptation; gender-equality; and improved nutritional practices; (2) deepening knowledge exchanges between women, poor, and vulnerable small-scale farmers in rural areas to identify and address their respective needs using mobile tools; and (3) strengthening evidence-based decision at the community level and provide stakeholder groups with access to compiled outcome data on food-security, agriculture and gender-equality. It is expected that this project impacts up to 7.3 million small-scale farmers, including an estimated 2.3 million women small-scale farmers in the four targeted countries.  Farm Radio International implements this project in partnership with FRI-Burkina Faso, FRI-Mali, FRI-Senegal, FRI-Ghana and CECI/Uniterra (Senegal).</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased use of interactive radio by radio stations and key stakeholders groups as a sustainable gender-responsive platform for quality information, communication and knowledge; (2) increased application of good agriculture and nutrition practices by small-scale women, men and youth farmers using interactive radio; and (3) increased application of gender transformative practices by rural men, women and youth using interactive radio in relation to family food security.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (April 2023) include: (1) reduction of moderate or severe family food insecurity for 526,710 male and female farmers and young people. This number is deducted from the 2,141,380 male and female farmers and youth reported at the beginning of the project; (2) 6% decrease in the gap between women and men. This gap is measured by the Empowerment Index, decreasing from 25% at the beginning of the project to 19% at the end. An 11.8% reduction in the gap between young people and adults is also reported, from 12% at the beginning of the project to 0.2% at the end; (3) 67% of the focus groups met perceive an improved level of the food security situation; and (4) 79% of the focus groups met perceive an improved level of the gender equality situation.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Promoting Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Adolescent Boys and Girls in the DRC</title>
    <description>The project aims to meet the needs of pre-adolescents and adolescents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with respect to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services that are gender-specific and adapted to their reality. To do so, the network of school and local community organizations has become involved to maximize awareness and engagement of key players. The project focuses on promoting and supporting positive and healthy social norms in order to encourage respectful, equitable and sustainable behaviours. Project activities include: (1) developing educational and promotional materials on positive norms of gender equality and sexual and reproductive health services and rights that take into account the adolescents’ age and gender; (2) setting up school clubs for adolescents attending school and community space for youth; (3) adapting and improving the quality of SRH services in health centres to meet the needs of adolescents; and (4) establishing and strengthening child and youth protection committees comprised of community members.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected results for this project include: 1) increased and equal access to high-quality information on sexual and reproductive health services and rights that takes into account the adolescents’ age and gender; 2) improved quality of adapted sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in health centres to meet the needs of adolescents; and 3) increased stakeholder capacity to create a social environment that supports adolescents in exercising their sexual and reproductive health rights and protects them from sexual and gender-based violence.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (June 2021) include: (1) 9,673 adolescents (5,440 of whom are girls) have participated in school clubs that educate them on gender equality, as well as sexual and reproductive health; (2) 20 community based organizations supported by the project by promoting gender equality as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights; (3) 284 health care providers (160 of whom are women) received training in sexual and reproductive health, women's and girl's sexual and reproductive rights, and providing support in cases of sexual and gender based violence; (4) 8,621 adolescent club members (4,643 of whom are girls) and 254 teachers of the family planning course attended information sessions on referral mechanisms and the mapping of sexual and gender based violence management services. They can now identify the steps to take, the available services and are encouraged to make quality referrals; (5) 114 providers (56 medical input managers and 58 people in charge of health training, 64 of whom are women and 50 of whom are men) received training on managing contraceptive inputs, so they are now better equipped to quantify contraceptive needs when making requisitions; and (6) empowerment of girls aged 10 to 14 increased by 7% from 2018 to 2021 and empowerment of girls aged 15 to 19 increased by 10%. As a result of the project's initiatives, adolescent girls are better informed, are more confident, and have enhanced their bargaining power to take actions regarding their lives despite social pressures and to claim their human rights.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Emergency Assistance - Regional-Level Funding for Africa, Americas and Asia - UNHCR 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – The Africa region continues to accommodate the largest population of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worldwide, with more than 20 million people in sub-Saharan forcibly-displaced. The Asia and Pacific region is home to 9.5 million people of concern to the UNHCR, and the Americas includes approximately 9 million persons of concern. The UNHCR provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally-displaced persons and searches for lasting solutions to their situations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the project provides assistance and protection to refugees, internally-displaced persons and other persons of concern in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation, and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, child protection, and working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and help issue identity documents; (5) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance and forge peaceful relations between refugees and local citizens; and (6) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for people of concern.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia – Nutrition Support for South Sudanese Refugees - Concern Worldwide  2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Ethiopia hosts the second largest number of refugees in Africa, nearly one million people. Approximatelyy 40% of these are from South Sudan and now live in the remote Gambella region of western Ethiopia. Although safe from the conflict and insecurity that forced them to flee, many refugees are still suffering from their effects, including acute malnutrition and trauma related to violence. With limited local options for self-sustainability and little chance of returning home in the near future, most refugee households remain reliant on ongoing international assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Concern Worldwide is providing nutritional assistance to an estimated 19,500 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. Activities include: (1) targeted therapeutic feeding of acutely malnourished children; (2) blanket supplementary feeding for households with vulnerable children; and (3) the provision of inputs to enhance dietary diversity amongst benficiary households.</description>

    <title>Sustainable Remediation in Ready-made Garments</title>
    <description>This multi-donor project supports the development of the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh that employs over 4 million people and is a key contributor to Bangladesh’s economic growth. Designed to drive up the quality of jobs, the project takes a coordinated approach to addressing long-standing challenges facing Bangladesh’s ready-made garment industry and to securing lasting improvements in garment factory working conditions. The project focuses particular attention on improving gender equality and empowerment of women, who constitute 70% of the garment sector workforce and face significant gender equality challenges, including gender segregation, wage differentials, low literacy rates, lack of maternity protection, sexual harassment and gender-based violence, and lack of awareness and advocacy on women’s rights.  Project activities include: (1) providing technical support for the timely remediation of 1,500 factories; (2) strengthening government capacity to better regulate industrial safety and establish an effective and gender-sensitive labour inspection system; (3) supporting the development of inclusive occupational safety and health policies and practices; and (4) implementing a scaled-up Better Work Program in Bangladesh, to improve garment sector compliance with international labour standards and competitiveness in global markets.</description>

    <title>Preventing Child, Early and Forced Marriage in Benin</title>
    <description>The project aims to promote sexual and reproductive health and adolescents’ and youth’s rights in Benin, by helping to reduce child, early and forced marriage in the Alibori and Borgou departments. To contribute to putting an end to child and early forced marriage and protect adolescent girls’ rights, the project works with communities to develop and promote local solutions. Capacity building of local actors and advocacy carried out by youth aim to create an environment conductive to the changes necessary to social and gender norms in order to end harmful traditional practices. Project activities include: (1) training on women’s and girls’ rights given to women, girls, men, boys and community and traditional leaders; (2) training health workers on adolescent sexual and reproductive health; and (3) providing complete sexual and reproductive health care for adolescents designed for youth.</description>

    <title>Addressing Gaps in the Reduction of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to an increased realization of the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women in Nigeria. Project activities include: (1) improving the knowledge and skills of government social workers and health care workers to provide age and culturally appropriate female genital mutilation/cutting and child, early and forced marriage prevention and treatment services; (2) upgrading health facilities to provide culturally appropriate and gender-sensitive quality services on harmful traditional practices (female genital mutilation/cutting and child, early and forced marriage), as well as obstetric fistula care; (3) supporting advocacy activities carried out by women-led legislative coalitions at community and state levels to domesticate anti-sexual and gender-based violence laws; (4) supporting gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate media activities to raise awareness and mobilize action against harmful traditional practices (female genital mutilation/cutting and child, early and forced marriage) and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (5) activating community platforms for dialogue on female genital mutilation/cutting, child, early and forced marriage, and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence to reach boys, men, women, traditional gatekeepers and religious leaders; and (6) raising awareness of women and girls of their rights, and building their knowledge and capacity to take action against all forms of sexual and gender-based violence. The project is expected to directly reach over 300,000 women, girls and boys 10 to 24 years of age, and potentially hundreds of thousands more indirectly in the targeted states.</description>

    <title>Promotion of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and Nutrition for Adolescent Girls</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve access to adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and nutrition services for girls and boys in Burkina Faso. It also aims to create an enabling environment for adolescent SRH, including recognition of their rights. The project provides training and technical assistance to public health providers in nearly 700 health centres, in order to promote good practices in the provision of adolescent-friendly SRH services that are respectful of their rights. The project also contributes to the development and replication of communication strategies and tools within the ministry of health and other family-planning, nutrition, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS partners. In addition, the project leads outreach and advocacy for teenagers, teachers, parents, communities and political decision-makers. Helen Keller International is implementing this project in partnership with Marie Stopes Burkina Faso and Farm Radio International.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved sexual and reproductive health services provided to adolescents in the health and social promotion centres of the health regions supported by the project; (2) increased use of improved sexual and reproductive health services, particularly family planning, nutrition and voluntary HIV testing by adolescents; and (3) the creation of an enabling environment for adolescent sexual and reproductive health, including recognition of their rights.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of  the end of the project (January 2022) include: (1) improved quality of sexual and reproductive health services provided to adolescents through the training of 840 health workers, including 561 women in the 29 districts covered by the adolescent sexual and reproductive health orientation program initiative. Of the 840 health workers trained, 594 providers (70.71%), including 417 women, obtained a score of at least 85% on the post-test allowing them to attend the training sessions. Since the beginning of the project in 2018, 448 supervised health worker trainings have been carried out; (2) by the end of the project, 230 teachers (including 56 women) will have been trained on the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescent girls and gender equality; (3) the creation of 1,508 school clubs comprising 7,800 members in the 66 partner institutions to improve adolescents’ knowledge and skills with respect to sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and their related rights; (4) There were 12 youth counselling centres and 6 school infirmaries that received equipment to maintain clinical and recreational activities in these adolescent centres, even after the project came to an end. Communication kits to promote the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and youth were received by 889 health centres; (5) the call centre received 81,986 calls—90% of the questions asked by adolescent girls and youth were concerning sexual and reproductive health in general and family planning in particular; and (6) routine activities that integrated sexual and reproductive health services were maintained by 36 voluntary HIV testing centres.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Promoting Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Benin</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce maternal mortality, gender-based violence and the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the Beninese population through the promotion of human rights in sexual and reproductive health. Canada is participating in the funding for this project through a delegated cooperation mechanism with the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Canada’s contribution supports a greater well-being in sexual and reproductive health of the population in the 12 sanitary zones targeted by this project, prioritizing adolescent girls. Project activities include: (1) providing comprehensive sexual education for girls and boys; (2) raising awareness among communities about socio-cultural barriers to sexual and reproductive health and related rights; and (3) strengthening basic services in the area of reproductive health services, including appropriate services for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community, and improved availability of contraceptive products.  The project is implemented by a consortium of three local organizations active in the field of sexual and reproductive health and rights: the Association béninoise pour le marketing social et la communication pour la santé, the Association béninoise pour la promotion de la famille  and CARE Bénin.</description>

    <title>Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health and Respect for the Rights of Adolescent Girls in Benin</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescent girls in the Atlantique and Mono departments of Benin.  The project supports more than 108,000 adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 in the full exercise of their fundamental rights in the area of sexual and reproductive health. Project activities include: (1) training health care providers and community health volunteers in sexual and reproductive health and respect for adolescent girls’ rights, including mental health; (2) providing sexual and reproductive health-related equipment to health centers, as well as modernize, expand or rehabilitate them, taking into account environmental standards; and (3) raising awareness among communities in terms of sexual and reproductive health and related rights of adolescent girls.  The project works with all relevant stakeholders to achieve these results: from governance structures to local actors; through youth associations and health structures. This approach, among other things, provides a full range of family planning services and has a lasting impact.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased demand for sexual and reproductive health services, especially among adolescent girls; (2) increased supply of adolescent girl-friendly, rights-based sexual and reproductive health services; and (3) governance structures empowered to better coordinate sexual and reproductive health prevention and care, while respecting the rights of adolescent girls.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2022): (1) adolescent girls (15 to 19 years) increased their use of sexually transmitted infections services, from less than 1% at the start to more than 20% at the end of the project; (2) 14,788 adolescent girls (15 to 19 years) accessed sexual and reproductive health care, doubling the project target; (3) gender focal points at all levels of the health pyramid have been established to build the capacity of structures, to promote gender equality and ensure its sustainable integration into supervision, training and coordination activities; (4) 96% of community associations and groups have integrated activities to promote sexual and reproductive health and respect for adolescents' rights; and (5) adolescent-friendly spaces were created in 8 communes. Integrating these spaces into community health centres improves the delivery of sexual and reproductive health services to adolescents by trained providers in an environment that meets their needs (privacy and confidentiality).</resultsAchieved>

    <title>A New and Dignified Life for Women and Girls Suffering from Obstetric Fistula</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the well-being of women and girls living with obstetric fistula, an important sexual and reproductive health and rights issue in Mozambique. Women who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation and health problems. The project aims to increase knowledge about obstetric fistula and the availability of routine treatment services in strategically selected national health facilities across the country. Project activities include: (1) increasing the availability and access to professional fistula treatment and care for young women and girls; and (2) strengthening gender-based and rights-based community engagement on obstetric fistula, involving women and girls, men and boys. A total of 6,898 women and girls are expected to receive services for the treatment and repair of obstetric fistula; 630 women and girls are to receive reintegration services; and 6,500 people are to receive community mobilization awareness sessions.</description>

    <title>Reaching the Poorest: Quality Sexual and Reproductive Health Services in Mozambique</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the quality of sexual and reproductive health services for 62,000 adolescent boys and girls (between the ages of 10 and 19 years) in and out of school. It is designed to address the social, cultural, and gender barriers faced by adolescents and promote cultural and behavioural change within communities in the districts of Milange, Morrumbala, and Derre in Zambézia province. Project activities include: (1) providing gender-sensitive and adolescent-friendly information about sexual and reproductive health and rights and related services in schools, health centers and communities, reaching up to 50,000 community members (of which 30,000 are women); (2) promoting community engagement and raising awareness around traditional adolescent initiation rites; and (3) supporting Children’s Parliaments, a platform where children and youth are able to share their views to the government and other key stakeholders.</description>

Women and girls face increased vulnerability in situations of conflict and displacement, as rape and other forms of sexual violence may be used systematically as an act of reprisal and to create fear. The consequences are far reaching, affecting survivors not only physically but psychologically and socially.  For this reason, ICRC has a special initiative to strengthen its response to sexual violence, with the intention of improving delivery of services, prevention of sexual violence, and improving the capacity of its staff to respond.  The ICRC also works with States, weapons bearers, religious and traditional leaders, and communities to promote awareness of sexual violence, including awareness of International Humanitarian Law obligations prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict. The ICRC has a unique role working in conflict zones, with access to areas inaccessible by many other organizations and with greater credibility in advocating for the protection of civilians, including vulnerable women and girls.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Equal and Inclusive Access to Birth Registration in Haiti</title>
    <description>The project seeks to improve access to quality birth registration services for all Haitians by strengthening the institutional and legal framework of Haiti’s vital statistics system and of other ministries concerned. The project focuses on the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups and on eliminating differences based on gender, economic condition or place of residence. Acquiring a legal individual identity promotes better inclusion of Haitian women and girls and optimizes their perspectives for personal, economic and social development.  The project activities include: (1) legal and policy reforms; (2) strategic planning of vital statistics; (3) capacity building and awareness activities; (4) incorporation of birth registration into other services, such as health and education; (5) registration of births in the communities and social mobilization campaigns for registration. The project uses innovative methods, such as the use of SMS messaging technology, and relies on the development of on-line birth registration systems.  The project’s activities focus on the departments of Artibonite (Saint-Marc, Gonaïves, Gros Morne and La Chapelle), Centre (Belladère, Thomonde, Thomassique and Cerca-la-Source) and Grande Anse (Les Irois, Anse-d’Ainault and Dame-Marie).</description>

    <title>Public Accountability and Women’s Participation in Mali</title>
    <description>This project seeks to improve accountability in Mali’s public sector by engaging citizens, especially women, to create responsible, transparent and inclusive governance. At the national level, large amounts of public revenue are still poorly managed, which negatively affects the accessibility and quality of government services for citizens, particularly women and girls. Also, civil society, including women’s organizations, is seldom included in public accountability. Project activities include the following: (1) building the capacity of the Office of the Auditor General of Mali (BVGM) to produce and disseminate audit reports that take gender equality into account; (2) providing support to the Ministry of Justice in its efforts to fight fraud and corruption; (3) building the capacity of civil society organizations, particularly women’s organizations, to use reports and recommendations from the BVGM and the Ministry of Justice to defend their rights and promote more responsible and inclusive governance.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected results for this project include the following: (1) better monitoring of the implementation of policies and programs promoting gender equality in Mali; (2) enhanced anti corruption practices that incorporate the impact on women’s empowerment; (3) increased engagement of civil society, especially women, in promoting good governance.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2022) include: (1) strengthened capacity and visibility of the Office of the Auditor General of Mali (BVGM) in terms of its strategic planning and specifically the inclusion of gender in its audits, which has contributed to strengthening the BVGM in its function of overseeing gender policies and programmes in Mali; (2) the staff of the Economic and Financial Poles from the Ministry of Justice are equipped to prosecute those responsible for criminal offences in the area of public finance, and sensitised on the integration of a gender perspective in their work; (3) a multi-actor framework for the fight against corruption is set up to strengthen anti-corruption practices in Mali bringing together actors from internal control, the justice sector and civil society; (4) more than 200 women leaders or members of Citizen Watch Committees have improved their advocacy and leadership skills, with a view to increasing the mobilisation of civil society, and in particular women, for the promotion of good governance at the local and national levels; and (5) more than 54,600 members of civil society, 51% of whom are women, have been trained on the gender-specific manifestations of corruption and their impact on women's access to basic social services. These results contribute to the improvement of inclusive and accountable governance in Mali and, ultimately, to the improvement of the socio-economic well-being of women and girls through the delivery of public services in Mali.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Uganda - Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees - CARE Canada 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, more than 1.4 million, with roughly two thirds of them having arrived from South Sudan since July 2016. This large and rapid influx has strained the humanitarian response capacity in northern Uganda to near breaking. New refugee settlements almost immediately reach full capacity, while service providers struggle to meet the most basic needs of the community. Overall, South Sudanese make up more than three quarters of the refugee population in Uganda (more than 1 million people).  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is providing support for much-needed healthcare (including sexual and reproductive health), shelter, and protection for an estimated 87,000 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Arua district of Uganda. Project activities include: (1) providing training, equipment and supplies to local health facilities; (2) construction of shelters to house new arrivals; and (3) enhancing available protection services for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and other vulnerable persons.</description>

    <title>Women’s Voice and Leadership – Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organizations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting activities, building institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the globally recognized, significant gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  This project provides Congolese women’s organizations with the tools, resources, funding and mentoring needed to strengthen and sustain their technical and organizational capacity to drive change and promote the rights of women and girls, as well as advance gender equality in five provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This project is implemented by The Carter Centre. Project activities include: (1) providing tailored, long-term training and mentorship for Congolese women’s organizations; (2) providing Congolese women’s organizations with direct, multi-year funding; (3) establishing and strengthening networks of women’s organizations by facilitating exchanges to share experiences, accomplishments and lessons learned in order to build solidarity around a common vision for the feminist movement; and (4) supporting women’s rights organizations in the design and development of their advocacy strategies.  This project supports new and innovative approaches to promote the rights of women and girls and advance their empowerment through a separate fund open to a broad range of Congolese women’s organizations.</description>

    <title>Future Forward: The Iraqi Women’s Leadership Initiative</title>
    <description>The project aims to strengthen women's leadership and secure their economic rights, thus contributing to good governance, peace and stability in Iraq. The project focuses on empowering women and girls in their homes and communities while working in a larger context of peace-building, transitional justice, and addressing the pervasive barriers women face to accessing their rights. Project activities include:  (1) launching a comprehensive leadership training program for 305 Iraqi women already in leadership positions in order to strengthen their effectiveness as politicians and increase their chances of being re-elected; (2) launching a mentorship program (500 mentees matched with 100 mentors) designed to inspire and equip younger women to become civic and political leaders; (3) supporting four women-led local partners to establish women’s support centers to begin providing direct legal services to 15,335 women, and to enable women to access the economic resources to which they are entitled. The centres also provide psychosocial support to 14,400 women, including survivors of gender-based violence; (4) providing a toolkit of women’s empowerment “micro-projects” that local partners can launch at their women’s support centers to build solidarity and peer networks through women’s empowerment programming, and supporting women to advocate within their homes and communities to change norms and behaviors; and (5) reaching 40,000 individuals through  “know your rights” campaigns, 10,000 persons through community-based organisations-led targeted campaigns designed to change norms and influence the behavior of male relatives and other influencers in the community, and 480 civil society leaders through facilitated discussions on policy and legislative reform. It is expected that the project will reach 65,815 individuals</description>

This led to the adoption of policies advancing women’s rights at various levels of government. These policies include mobilizing budget resources to implement the 1325 Iraqi National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; (3) established “Women’s Empowerment Units” at the governorate level and improved the Government of Iraq’s support for survivors of domestic violence. This includes providing free legal consultations, establishing a toll-free hotline to report gender-based violence, and providing referrals for support; (4) increased the ability for women to claim their rights in court effectively. The project provided 5,627 women affected by gender-based violence with legal services, helping 99% of them win their cases. Also, 1,022 women benefited from provided mediation sessions that  dissuaded them from dropping their rights related to divorce and land tenure. This ensured that they received the financial compensation (e.g., child support) they were entitled to under the law; (5) 9,970 women received psychosocial support, which helped improve their emotional well-being; (6) provided 62 women with microloans to start their businesses, and 483 received vocational training that helped them earn a better living; (7) reached 6,260 men and boys with targeted messages tackling harmful social attitudes and helping to increase community support for women’s rights; and (8) led 55 tribal leaders to sign a commitment to end the practice of forced marriages of young women and girls to settle tribal disputes through advocacy efforts.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Supporting Women's Resilience in Crisis in Lebanon</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to the economic empowerment of Lebanese women and Syrian refugee women in Lebanon. This project is part of the UNDP’s Lebanon Host Communities Support Programme (LHSP), a national initiative launched jointly with Lebanon’s Ministry of Social Affairs as a comprehensive response to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and its implications on Lebanon.  The project supports women-led businesses and women to actively participate in the local economy, and strengthens the role that local authorities (such as municipalities, municipal unions and local economic development organizations) play in advancing women’s economic empowerment in Lebanon.  Project activities include: (1) providing training, paid internships, coaching and mentoring to Lebanese women and Syrian refugee women to strengthen their abilities to integrate into the economic sphere; (2) offering training, mentoring, marketing and financial support services to women-led businesses in order to improve their productivity and competitiveness; (3) organizing advocacy and awareness-raising activities to strengthen public support of women’s economic empowerment and reduce social barriers; and (4) providing technical, strategic and management training and support to municipalities to better mainstream gender considerations into economic development strategies and interventions.  The project is expected to reach 103,000 individuals through training, direct services and awareness campaigns, and to create or maintain up to 700 jobs.</description>

    <title>Improving Community Resilience in Kenya's Climate Sensitive Lands</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen the resilience of about 700,000 people living on the most ecologically fragile lands in Kenya, particularly the most vulnerable women and young people. The World Food Program (WFP) works to strengthen the capacity of communities to improve their agricultural production and access new markets, including through land rehabilitation for longer-term harvesting and improved water management. This enables them to increase their food security and reduce hunger in an arid region where a drought often follows the harvest season. Microinsurance products for smallholder farmers, a key risk management mechanism and a way to put farmers on a path of resilience, are to be developed. The project also aims to better equip county governments (where agriculture is a deconcentrated function) to better serve small farmers and to re-direct public funds towards rural development and resilience.</description>

    <title>Mobilizing Domestic Revenues for Inclusive Poverty Alleviation in Ghana</title>
    <description>The project aims to champion inclusive and accountable governance, and to improve the participation of women in making decisions related to budget planning and allocation, and service delivery at the district and municipal government levels. The project supports the modernization of local property tax systems of 60 districts and municipal governments across Ghana, helping them increase their revenue generation capacity so that they can invest in poverty reduction priorities which impact women and girls.  Project activities include: (1) providing training on budget planning, gender budgeting and gender equitable local services to improve local public financial management; (2) developing  standards for citizen participation, specifically of women, in budgeting and planning (such as public budget hearings); (3) technical assistance on how to engage and empower women; public education regarding the tax system; (4) providing training to civil society and women’s organizations on gender budgeting and participatory planning; and (5) using information technologies and digital databases to assemble basic information required by a modern revenue system: property and business location mapping, property valuation and assessment, and socio-economic taxpayer data.  The project is implemented by Canada in collaboration with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved gender-responsive planning and budgeting capacity of local governments; (2) increased capacity of districts to respond to the service delivery needs of women and vulnerable groups; and (3) increased public participation, specifically women, in planning and budgeting for gender equitable service delivery to the poor.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2020 include: (1) 92 metropolitan and municipal district assemblies (MMDAs) in Ghana improved their planning, budgeting, revenue mobilization, out of a target of 60 MMDAs; (2) 1,406 officers (of which 422 were women) at the District Planning and Coordinating Units were trained by 50 trainers across the country on gender mainstreaming responsiveness in planning and budgeting at the sub-national level, resulting in MMDAs incorporating more gender-specific considerations within annual development plans and budgets; (3) trained 150 women and 60 traditional women leaders (Queen Mothers) to analyze local government plans and budgets' gender-responsiveness. As a result, these women were included in the planning and budgeting processes of their local assemblies and put forward concerns that are relevant to women constituents within their communities; (4) 61 participating local authorities adopted an electronic system for revenue collection and management referred to as dLRev, to enhance the effectiveness  and transparency of revenue mobilization and result in an increase to 399,000 taxpayers; (5) 42 out of a target of 45 participating local authorities increased their capacity to develop revenue management plans; (4) the project partner established a decision-making body to assess gender-responsive infrastructure projects in six partner districts, which will include the construction of a child welfare centre, market facilities and reproductive health facilities; and (6) the capacity of Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs) across the 61 participating local authorities was strengthened on stakeholder engagement (decentralisation actors, civil society, and academic institutions) around key issues, especially concerning women’s participation in decision-making. Through the technical advice of the RCCs, all participating local authorities prepared their composite intersectoral medium-term plans that incorporated gender-specific considerations, which were certified and approved by the National Development Planning Commission.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Supporting the Participation of Women's Advisory Boards in Local Governance</title>
    <description>The project aims to enhance the role of women in local governance, transform the way local councils interact with women, and improve local government’s responsiveness to key issues identified by women advocates in five areas of Iraq that were retaken from or are vulnerable to Daesh. The project aims to create and support five women’s advisory boards in Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salahaddin. Through these advisory boards and local councils, women elaborate development plans  that include community interests and prioritize the safe inclusion of women and girls.  Project activities include: (1) empowering women to influence local decision-making by supplying them with research on community priorities; (2) building their organizing and advocacy skills; and (3) making financial resources available to women for local development projects.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) an increased role for women in building trust between local government and communities in areas retaken from Daesh; and (2) enhanced cooperation between women activists and local government to respond to community needs.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2022) include: (1) established five Women’s Advisory Boards (WABs) to help build trust between local governments and the communities they represent. The WABs met with local government officials many times to explain the project’s objectives. They trained them to consult effectively with their communities. This led to 217 officials supporting the work of the WABs network. For example, in Kirkuk, citizens were skeptical about COVID-19 information disseminated by local authorities and did not follow the required safety measures. The Kirkuk WAB designed a community advocacy campaign to help raise awareness about COVID-19 information safety measures and organized an in-person public meeting between local government representatives and citizens to address questions and build trust between both groups. This resulted in citizens taking official COVID-19 health and safety measures more seriously; and (2) established strong relationships between the WABs and all levels of government, including Provincial Councils (PCs), governors and mayors. This helped the project work seamlessly when they suspended the PCs in 2019. The WABs worked on 21 local initiatives and conducted 189 community outreach events with local officials over the project`s duration. Many local development initiatives dealt with girls' access to education, which had deteriorated during the conflict with Daesh and also impacted by COVID-19.  21 local officials continued to support the WABs work after the project ended and locally maintained its benefits.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Women's Voice and Leadership - South Sudan</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organizations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting their activities, building institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building, as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the significant, globally recognized gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  The project is implemented by CARE Canada, who is supporting an estimated 15 women’s rights organizations in South Sudan to pursue their agendas and priorities. The organizations are working  across the former states of Jonglei, Central Equatoria, and Eastern Equatoria.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved management and sustainability of local women’s rights organizations in South Sudan, particularly those representing vulnerable and marginalized women and girls; (2) enhanced performance of women’s rights organizations’ programming and advocacy to advance gender equality and empower women and girls; and (3) increased effectiveness of national and sub-national women’s rights platforms, networks, and alliances to affect gender-sensitive policy change and policy implementation in South Sudan.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) 48 rapid response and multi-year grants were provided to over 30 women-led organizations (WLOs) and 3 networks ranging from 30,000 to 160,000 Canadian dollars. These funds allowed WLOs to reach over 100,000 people with gender-targeted programming at the community and state level, of which 70% were women; (2) WLOs and networks were able to influence 15 out of 17 policies or mechanisms, demonstrating a success rate of 88% – much higher than the target of 40%. Moreover, all multi-year grantees reported a high ability to engage in networks and to work with others to achieve a common goal. One of the most impactful contributions made by WLOs, networks and communities was advocacy that contributed to the ratification of the Maputo Protocol by the government of South Sudan; (3) 87% of WLOs diversified their sources of funding compared to a target of 75%. Six WLOs who had not received funding prior to the project have now diversified their funding, including 4 WLOs located in more rural areas. These results indicate that the project had a direct impact on increasing the sustainability of WLOs; and (4) Over 30 WLOs including 360 staff/volunteers participated in three networks supported by the project across the three regions. These networks allowed WLOs to foster partnerships, collaborative advocacy, influence policy, and advocate in the safety of numbers.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Rebuilding Communities and Improving the Well-Being of Women and Girls in Iraq</title>
    <description>The project works at improving the well-being for the most vulnerable women and girls in Iraq. It aims to do so by: creating safe spaces for women and girls to support them in their collective efforts for positive change; supporting meaningful community participation by women; working with men and boys to promote gender equality and positive role models; supporting local women’s rights defenders; contributing to an inclusive, women-led accountable Women, Peace and Security agenda. Project activities include: (1) building the capacity of parliamentarians (women and men) towards policy development that strives to improve gender equality (GE) and promote the participation of women in the rebuilding of their communities; (2) providing technical and financial assistance for women's rights organisations (WROs) and groups of women’s rights defenders, including, training and coaching in GE, human rights (HR), policy development, network development and livelihoods programming; (3) with the assistance of the WROs, establishing child-friendly women’s spaces where women can meet to seek assistance, education, exchange ideas and discuss matters of importance to the rebuilding of their communities; (4) training for community leaders (who are mostly men), as well as men and boys in GE and issues pertaining to women and girls (and in some cases men and boys) in their communities such as HR, sexual and gender-based violence, and sexual and reproductive health and rights, in order to garner support for improved lives of their mothers, sisters and daughters; (5) establishing networks between women, WROs and community leaders to ensure women’s voices are heard and that they participate in the rebuilding of their communities, develop and conduct a social media campaign with GE messaging based on the work with community leaders, men, boys, women and girls to champion GE.  .</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved social and political environment for the effective participation of women and girls in governance structures; and (2) increased active participation of women and girls in public and political life, and decision-making processes as transformative leaders.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) strengthened the capacity of 2 Women’s Rights Organizations (WROs), the Youth Activity Organization in Diyala, and the Iraq Al Amal Association (IAA) in Kirkuk to deliver awareness-raising activities. IAA convened a national conference for women in collaboration with the Iraq Women Network: “Together to eliminate violence against women and impunity,” attended by 395 participants (105 men, 258 women, 9 girls, and 23 boys), local government and civil society organization representatives from various governorates of Iraq. 13 other WROs participated in a “16 Days of Activism” campaign. Other partners supported the “Orange the world: End violence against women now!” campaign to act against gender-based violence in Iraq; (2) conducted a study on barriers influencing women and girls’ access to public life and decision-making in Diyala and Kirkuk. Oxfam used findings from the study to design activities that addressed the most pressing issues raised by project beneficiaries. The evidence-based studies focused on gender analysis and policy review, the feminist and women’s movement in Iraq, and social norms structuring masculinities, gender roles, and stereotypes. Through 200 awareness-raising sessions, the project reached 2,462 women and girls who in turn articulated and voiced their social, economic, political and sexual health and reproductive rights.  A separate set of community dialogues held at the national and regional levels for citizens to meet their leaders and dialogue on key gender issues of concern reached 214 individuals (90 women, 62 men, 41 girls and 21 boys). 223 women received training to improve their knowledge and skills in business management, and 100 of the attendees obtained grants to help sustain their businesses (50 in Diyala; 50 in Kirkuk); and (3) 300 women in 10 project locations received advocacy training, and 46 change makers (26 women, 20 men) and 36 women leaders on awareness raising for women and girls. In the lead-up to the 2021 Iraq general election, local women’s rights organization Iraqi Al-Amal led a workshop in 5 governorates, empower women candidates vying for seats in the Iraqi parliament. This Leadership Program provided capacity strengthening through tailored training for selected WROs, women in WROs, key interlocutors and young activists to increase their competencies in policy advocacy. During the election, learning sessions proved fruitful as 2 of the women candidates from the workshop ultimately succeeded in their political campaigns, becoming elected members of the Iraqi parliament.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Livelihood Support and Women's Empowerment in Cox's Bazar</title>
    <description>This project provides comprehensive livelihood support for communities, particularly women, girls and young adolescents, living in the host communities affected by the influx of over 740,000 displaced Rohingya people in  Cox’s Bazar since August 2017. Cox’s Bazar is one of Bangladesh’s poorest and most vulnerable districts, with the poverty rate well above the national average. Even before the influx, 33% of the host community population lived below the poverty line and 17% below the extreme poverty line. The arrival of the refugees has increased the supply of labour in the affected areas, driving down wages and increasing competition in the labour market, with a particular impact on the poorest host community households including those whose primary source of income is day labour. The influx has also put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services which were already scarce and overstretched. Women and girls, and women-headed households, are particularly vulnerable in this situation, including to gender-based violence which is likely to increase in times of economic stress.  The project is designed to meet the immediate needs of the affected host communities in selected sub-districts in Cox’s Bazar, while building skills, resilience and awareness to facilitate their long-term well-being. With a focus on empowering and girls, the objective is to lift the most affected host communities out of poverty through a program that combines livelihoods, social safety nets, financial inclusion and social integration. Activities include: providing grants and related support to ultra-poor women for income generation activities such as home gardening and poultry-rearing; ; improving household food  consumption; employment-linked apprenticeship training for out-of-school youth and adolescents (male and female); facilitating production and retailing of traditional clothing materials by women artisans; and targeted training of community health workers and midwives to help address the essential health needs of the most vulnerable host communities. The activities are expected to directly benefit over 10,000 women and young adults and reach over 200,000 members of their households.</description>

    <title>Women Engaged for Human Dignity in Northern Benin</title>
    <description>The objective of the project is to reduce the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV), particularly female genital mutilation (FGM) in the Departements of Borgou and Alibori in Benin. The project is based on a multi-sector approach which fosters social change in individual and collective behaviour, as well as a shift in social norms that justify and perpetuate these practices. The project activities include: 1) training women, men, girls and boys on gender equality, sexual and reproductive rights, and the adverse effects of female genital mutilation; 2) supporting the central government in reviewing and harmonizing women’s rights policies and strategies by integrating GBV and FGM issues; 3) supporting professionals from health and education institutions to identify and implement activities geared towards eliminating mutilation FGM and other gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Emergency Regional Funding for Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean - ICRC Appeals 2018</title>
    <description>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect the lives and dignity of people affected by conflict and other situations of violence. The ICRC provides assistance and prevents further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s emergency operations aim to provide protection, food assistance, health services, livelihood support and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. This funding is un-earmarked to support ICRC activities across the Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Project activities include: (1) protecting and assisting people affected by conflict and violence, such as by providing medical care, access to potable water, and restoring livelihoods; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise in areas such as promotion of international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and health care provision in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees.</description>

    <title>Sahel Crisis - Global Support - Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 - Conditions across the Sahel belt and neighbouring countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have deteriorated, resulting in a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by a range of factors including poverty, political and economic instability, conflict and climate change. The current conditions with respect to rainfall resemble that seen in 2011-2012, when drought and crop production shortfalls caused a major food crisis. The drought situation is expected to result in intensified food insecurity and increased humanitarian needs throughout 2018 and into the next year.  With GAC's support, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is building the resilience and strengthening regional coordination in drought-affected countries, including: Chad, Niger, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso. The project aims to protect the livelihoods of vulnerable groups, such as pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, via livestock support. Project activities include: (1) providing veterinary supplies, such as emergency animal feed, pest control products, vaccines and deworming treatments; (2) providing cash transfer, destocking and cash-for-work activities; (3) producing forage and managing pasture; and (4) disseminating lessons learned and good practices, as well as facilitating dialogue between countries, on transhumance (seasonal movement of livestock) and transboundary issues.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Coalition - Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund, Phase III - 2019-2020</title>
    <description>The Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund (CHAF), managed by the Humanitarian Coalition (HC), supports timely and reliable humanitarian assistance to those affected by rapid-onset, small- and medium-scale disasters in developing countries. Through the CHAF, funds are allocated to the Humanitarian Coalition member best placed to respond to a particular emergency. The Humanitarian Coalition is made up of seven Canadian non-governmental organizations: Canadian Lutheran World Relief, CARE Canada, Islamic Relief Canada, Oxfam Canada, Oxfam-Québec, Plan Canada and Save the Children Canada.  In the second phase of the project, CHAF supported 40 projects by member organizations to respond to sudden-onset small-scale disasters in a timely manner. This two-year, third phase of the CHAF continues to finance responses to smaller-scale disasters where there are unmet humanitarian needs and gaps in the humanitarian response. The project also allows for responses to medium-scale disasters.  With GAC's support, the CHAF is: (1) promoting early actions and responses to reduce loss of life; (2) improving the speed of emergency responses; and (3) supporting live-saving activities such as health care, protection services, and emergency shelter, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene services.</description>

    <title>Program for Municipal Leadership Inclusive of Women in Tunisia</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the influence of citizens and women leaders at the local level in the management of communal affairs. It aims to build the capacity of at least 300 elected women and local leaders involved in municipal politics. In addition, the project contributes to the development of inclusive municipal policies and services for women and girls that have an impact on women and girls and vulnerable groups, such as women and youth in marginalized areas.  The activities of this project include: 1) implementing training programs for elected men and women to recognize and support women’s leadership; 2) carry out a study of civil society in targeted municipalities for the development of gender-sensitive public services; 3) raise awareness among government bodies and the National Federation of Tunisian Cities (FNVT) of the gender equality aspect in the management of local affairs.  The project is helping to raise awareness of women ' s leadership and participation among some 7,206 electoral advisers, including 3,500 women. Eight municipalities are targeted by the project, with a population of approximately 350,000 inhabitants, half of whom are women.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2023 include: (1) prepared and launched a Tunisian Charter on the Right to the City, and put in place a social contract to promote sustainable, safe and inclusive cities. This represents a first in Arab countries; (2) reviewed and adopted 49 recommendations integrating gender by the municipal council; (3) created 20 inclusive and gender-specific services in the eight partner municipalities. Thirty-five more are under development, involving public spaces, a public market, a kindergarten, a public beach, etc; (4) engaged with 45 civil society organizations in the implementation of pilot projects, as well as in other gender equality initiatives; (5) trained and carried out various workshops for the benefit of 1,498 people reached by the project, including 1,215 women and 283 men; (6) carried out training on gender and inclusive approaches for 706 people, including 706 women and 202 men, from municipal councils, municipal administration and civil society; (7) established four municipal children's councils by the communes. These councils are being supported as they draw up their first action plans; (8) founded the Tunisian Elected Women's Network, whose membership reached 1,000 by the end of the project; (9) trained and supported 51 women leaders involved in their communities and associations through the program; (10) finalized seven pilot projects. Several of these meet women's needs for places to meet and relax; (11) strengthened the National Federation of Tunisian Communes to adopt gender mainstreaming measures. These include a guide to inclusive communication and gendered action plans; (12) significantly increased and mobilized the membership of the National Committee for the Promotion of Equality between Women and Men in the Management of Local Affairs. This helps to keep the women's rights and gender equality agenda visible, and to oversee legislation; (13) created 10 knowledge products, including videos, guides, case studies and best practice documents. The beneficiaries of this initiative are municipalities, organizations and individuals who want to develop gendered and inclusive practices at the local level; and (14) organized the "Tunisian-Canadian Fortnight of Municipal Exchanges" event, mobilizing 250 people from both sides of the Atlantic.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to Rohingya Refugee Crisis - IRC 2019</title>
    <description>December 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months.These refugees joined an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The majority of the refugees are women and children.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) aims to improve the health and safety of vulnerable populations in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, by providing access to a wide range of services to women, adolescent girls and refugees at large. Activities include: (1) establishing three women and girls safe spaces offering basic sexual and reproductive health services, psychosocial support and gender-based violence case management; and (2) establishing a basic emergency and neonatal care center that provides a more comprehensive package of sexual and reproductive health services, including obstetrics care.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Hygiene, Health and Nutrition Assistance  - Save the Children 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 14.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and a total of 4.3 million people have been displaced over the last four years. Yemen is also facing one of the worst cholera epidemics in recorded history, as well as a diphtheria outbreak, the scale of which is compounded by the dire state of water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and health services. Nearly half of the health facilities have been destroyed or are only partially functioning, stocks of medical supplies are low, and many health professionals are working for free or receiving substantially reduced wages. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene, health and nutrition assistance to up to 156,957 conflict-affected people in Taiz, one of the most affected governorates in Yemen located on the frontline of the conflict. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water and sanitation facilities; (2) screening and treatment of acute malnutrition cases; (3) providing sexual and reproductive health services; and (4) providing essential medicines.</description>

    <title>Pooled Fund in the Democratic Republic of Congo - UNDP 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - From new violence in peaceful areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), such as Ituri, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and IDPs, 2018 pushed the limits of DRC's humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services exacerbated live-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict and where widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence, are a defining feature. In 2018 alone, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the DRC Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international NGOs as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in the DRC. The CBPF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national non-governmental organizations, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and a total of 4.3 million people have been displaced over the last four years.

Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund  channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of conflict-affected populations, providing much needed flexibility in a rapidly evolving context. Project activities include: (1) providing needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (2) strengthening the coordination and coherence of humanitarian assistance; (3) funding priority sectors as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (4) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Election Observation Missions: Ukraine 2019 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections</title>
    <description>The project aims to set up and deploy two election observation missions: one for the presidential election process, and one for the parliamentary election process in Ukraine, both to be held in 2019. The purpose of the project is to support more transparent, accountable, inclusive and gender-responsive electoral processes in Ukraine.  These two missions are composed of up to 100 Canadian long-term election observers (LTOs), with a gender and regional balance. The missions are managed by a core team located in Kyiv and are deployed to all regions of Ukraine. The activities of the LTO missions include: (1) observe and report on both electoral processes for up to three months prior to and following Election Day; (2) establish working relationships with stakeholders, including the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, regional and local authorities, civil society groups such as organizations promoting women and minority rights, international organizations and other electoral observation missions; and (3) liaise with the media in Canada and Ukraine to ensure visibility of the electoral observation process.  The project seeks to screen and recruit up to 500 Canadian short-term election observers (STOs) ensuring gender and geographical balance; and deploy them to the presidential and parliamentary electoral observation missions of the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and contribute to the final reports.</description>

    <title>Commonwealth of Learning - Institutional Support 2019-2021</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada's long term institutional support to the Commonwealth of Learning (COL). The COL uses these funds, along with other donor funding, to achieve its mandate. The COL’s mandate is to help governments, institutions and organizations expand the scale, efficiency and quality of learning by using appropriate open, distance and technology-enabled learning.  Project activities aim to strengthen member countries’ capacities to develop the human resources required for their economic and social development. The work of the COL is guided by its 2015-2021 Strategic Plan. Through this plan, the COL focuses its programming on two sectors, education and skills, with gender equality as a cross-cutting theme. In the education sector, the COL supports countries, institutions and organizations in their development of formal education mechanisms, including open schooling, higher education, the Virtual University for Small States of the Commonwealth and teacher education. In the skills sector, the COL supports institutions and organizations in developing formal and non-formal learning opportunities that focus on healthy communities, technical and vocational skills development and technology enabled learning.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Assistance for Displaced Persons - CARE Canada 2019-2020</title>
    <description>In 2019, drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is helping to address the critical food security, water and sanitation, and protection needs of up to 40,000 people displaced by conflict in the remote Liben zone of Ethiopia’s Somali region. This intervention is providing cash, safe water and sanitation, while also addressing the longer-term impacts of displacement and the challenges of eventual returns, by improving livelihoods opportunities, particularly for vulnerable women and girls.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Emergency Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Shelter Assistance - CLWR 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Internally displaced populations are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Lutheran World Relief (CLWR) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up 49,000 people displaced by conflict in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. This project focuses on improving water, sanitation and hygiene conditions and gender-sensitive infrastructures, improving the safety and quality of shelters, and increasing access to agricultural inputs. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating 20 hand-dug wells, 9 shallow wells, and 6 ponds in the targeted communities; (2) distributing cooking and eating utensils benefiting up to 2,672 households; (3) distributing hand tools, and cereal and legume seeds to internally displaced people and host community households; and (4) constructing 4 gender-sensitive communal latrines for internally displaced people.</description>

    <title>Somalia - Emergency Health, Nutrition, Water and Sanitation Assistance - ACF 2019-2021</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Decades of political instability have left Somalia facing a complex and protracted humanitarian crises with an estimated 4.2 million Somalis (35 percent of the population) expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2019. Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of around 41,000 conflict-displaced people and host communities in the remote and hard to access Bakool region of Somalia. This project focuses on helping provide support to health facilities, treatment for acute malnutrition, rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities, and cash to help meet basic needs. Project activities include: (1) training health workers on management of childhood illnesses; (2) providing of prenatal consultations to pregnant women and postnatal consultations to lactating women; (3) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene supplies to people in vulnerable communities, including internally-displaced people; and (4) constructing emergency latrines that meet the protective needs and privacy of women and girls.</description>

Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 51,662 disaster-affected people in the Lower Juba region of Somalia. This project focuses on providing critical lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene services, gender responsive protection services, and livelihoods assistance. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating up to 9 strategic community water points; (2) conducting information sessions on the prevention of gender-based violence, and awareness sessions on the protection of women and children; and (3) engaging up to 600 households in cash-for-work activities to improve access to equitable livelihoods.</description>

    <title>Somalia - Emergency Assistance - World Vision Canada 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Decades of political instability have left Somalia facing a complex and protracted humanitarian crises with an estimated 4.2 million Somalis (35 percent of the population) expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2019. Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to the basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access to services a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With GAC’s support, World Vision Canada is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 358,001 returnees and internally displaced people in the Baidoa region of Somalia. The project focuses on improving access to emergency health and nutrition services, water, sanitation and hygiene services, and increasing safety and protection of internally displaced people and returnees. Project activities include: (1) supporting up to 10 health posts with essential supplies and equipment; (2) the construction or rehabilitation of community water points and sanitation facilities; and (3) strengthening local referral systems for protection cases.</description>

    <title>Integrating Venezuelan children in Peru</title>
    <description>The project aims to help ensure that Venezuelan migrant children and adolescents, particularly girls and adolescent girls, live free from violence and discrimination, and exercise their rights to protection, education and health in strengthened host communities in Peru. The project works with the Peruvian ministries of Education, of Health, and of Women and Vulnerable Populations, as well as with civil society organizations to promote gender-sensitive and inclusive education, and health and protection services. The project advocates for, and assists in updating regulatory frameworks and other instruments to grant migrants access to services. It seeks to empower adolescent girls to make them aware of their rights, and foster egalitarian relations between girls and boys. The project works to generate gender-disaggregated data and rapid assessments to determine the immediate needs and priorities of Venezuelan children and adolescents. It targets two regions of Peru: northern Lima, where most of the settled Venezuelan population is concentrated; and, to a lesser extent Tumbes, the main entry point for Venezuelans coming to Peru. It aims to benefit 25,000 Venezuelan children and adolescents, including 19,000 enrolled in schools. Additionally, the project aims to benefit 150,000 Venezuelan and Peruvians in host communities reached by messages aimed at preventing violence and discrimination.</description>

    <title>Empowering Women and Girls through Education and Skills in the Chittagong Hill Tracts</title>
    <description>The project aims to address barriers that hinder the demand for and access to education for girls, adolescent girls and women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region in south-eastern Bangladesh. The CHT is a multi-ethnic, conflict-affected region where poverty and cultural norms severely restrict access to basic education and employment for girls and women from both indigenous and settler populations. The project addresses the barriers through support to 300 pre-primary and primary schools, serving approximately 20,000 students, and through skills training. Activities are designed to provide inclusive, gender- and environmentally-responsive education at the pre-primary and primary levels; and increase access to gender-sensitive, demand-driven technical and vocational education and training for adolescent girls and women, including those with disabilities. The project aims to improve the retention rates for approximately 12,000 girls and adolescent girls; strengthen the knowledge and skill levels of approximately 900 teachers; and enhance employment opportunities for approximately 1,000 adolescent girls and women.</description>

    <title>Menstrual health for sexual and reproductive health and rights</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women and adolescent girls in Burkina Faso, Liberia, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. This is done through menstrual health and hygiene interventions. Project activities include: (1) refurbishing and constructing gender-sensitive latrines and sanitation stations for improved menstrual hygiene management in schools, healthcare facilities and communities; (2) engaging local businesses, women entrepreneurs and youth groups to supply menstrual hygiene products; and (3) lobbying government authorities to develop plans, policies and budgets for menstrual health management in schools, communities and healthcare centers.  This project directly benefits 91,450 people, of whom 72% women, including youth under the age of 19. WaterAid Canada, in partnership with Canada World Youth and Simavi leads the project.</description>

    <title>Women's Voice and Leadership - South Africa</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organisations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting activities, building institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the globally recognized, significant gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  In South Africa, the project is implemented by a national women’s rights organization called Gender Links. The project aims to strengthen an estimated 85 local women’s rights organizations, including 2 networks, and to provide them with the capacity, resources and opportunity to advance their priorities for gender equality and women’s empowerment across the most marginalized areas of the country.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Accountability through Timely Investigation of Atrocities</title>
    <description>This project supports investigations into alleged human rights abuses, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including sexual and gender-based violence and conflict-related violations involving children. The project works to deploy specialized experts, including forensics investigators, children's rights specialists, gender experts, specially trained translators and criminal investigators.  The investigative work carried out by these experts increases the international community’s capacity to ensure justice and accountability by enhancing justice and accountability mechanisms around the world to more effectively investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of grave international crimes and human rights violations.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Doctors Without Borders 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months.These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders is helping to meet the basic health needs of Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, focusing particularly on women and girls. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services for pregnant and lactating women; (2) providing maternity and neonatal care; (3) providing psychosocial support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; (4) providing 24/7 emergency room services where quality care and treatment are provided for women, men, girls and boys requiring secondary healthcare; (5) pediatric care for girls and boys under the age of 15; and (6) providing referrals to patients with complex cases, as well as regular monitoring of the quality of these referrals and patient outcomes.</description>

    <title>Prevention and Reduction of Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict Situations - ICRC 2019</title>
    <description>This project supports the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its work to prevent and reduce sexual violence in armed conflicts. Women and girls face increased vulnerability in situations of conflict and displacement, as rape and other forms of sexual violence may be used systematically as an act of reprisal and to create fear. The consequences are far reaching, affecting survivors not only physically but psychologically and socially.  For this reason, ICRC has a special initiative to strengthen its response to sexual violence, with the intention of improving delivery of services, prevention of sexual violence, and improving the capacity of its staff to respond.  The ICRC also works with States, weapons bearers, religious and traditional leaders, and communities to promote awareness of sexual violence, including awareness of International Humanitarian Law obligations prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict. The ICRC has a unique role working in conflict zones, with access to areas inaccessible by many other organizations and with greater credibility in advocating for the protection of civilians, including vulnerable women and girls.</description>

    <title>Sudan - Emergency Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Protection Assistance - ADRA 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across Sudan as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 2 million people are internally displaced within the country. Instability around Sudan’s borders has also led to thousands seeking asylum and refuge in Sudan. The number of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan is over 844,000, making Sudan the largest host of South Sudanese. Refugees, asylum seekers and migrants from Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Syria are also present, bringing the total number of refugees to 1.2 million. An estimated 5.7 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds.  With GAC’s support, ADRA Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene and protection assistance for up to 112,907 conflict-affected people in Sudan’s Blue Nile state. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating 18 hand pumps and 7 water systems in 8 settlements; (2) constructing gender-sensitive latrines and handwashing facilities in 6 schools and 6 health centers; (3) providing latrine slabs to 1,000 households; and (4) training 240 women and men community leaders in mediation, gender equality, and sexual and reproductive health and rights issues.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Capacity to Coordinate Responses to Gender-Based Violence in the Middle East</title>
    <description>June 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and refugees facing protracted displacement in host countries continue to face acute humanitarian needs in Jordan and Lebanon.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) supports the coordination of humanitarian responses to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) across the Middle East, namely in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Project activities include: (1) improving , informing and implementing cluster SGBV and SRH services and strategies; (2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of the GBV and SRH responses, including producing informational and analytical products; and (3) building the capacity of frontline, local and national SGBV-response and SRH actors to provide quality SGBV and SRH responses.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis in the DRC - Emergency Medical Response - IFRC 2019</title>
    <description>August 1, 2018 - A 10th outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the DRC. These provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, and over one million internally displaced people. The continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, represents a risk of spreading the outbreak to other provinces and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Appeal works to support Red Cross Societies’ staff and volunteers to carry out relief operations focussed on epidemic control through: community-based surveillance and response mechanisms; safe and dignified burials; risk communication; social mobilization and community engagement; infection prevention and control; support to health facilities and communities; and psychosocial support.  The project  includes the DRC response, and preparedness activities in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda. Project activities include: (1) establishing and maintaining  infection prevention and control measures in health facilities; (2) providing psychosocial support to Ebola patients and their families; (3) conducting advocacy and community outreach on Ebola prevention, detection and control; and (4) advocating for access by humanitarian personnel to affected and at-risk communities.</description>

    <title>Emergency Regional Funding - ICRC Appeals 2019</title>
    <description>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect the lives and dignity of people affected by conflict and other situations of violence. The ICRC provides assistance and prevents further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. The ICRC works with local Red Cross and Red Crescent national society staff and volunteers to implement its protection and assistance programmes worldwide.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s 2019 humanitarian operations aim to provide protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. This funding supports the ICRC’s activities across the Africa, Asia, and Central America regions. This funding also supports the new pilot initiative launched by the ICRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) aimed Red Cross and Red Crescent society capacity strengthening, prioritizing the most fragile situations where needs are greatest. Project activities include: (1) protecting and assisting people affected by conflict and violence, such as by providing medical care, access to potable water, and restoring livelihoods; (2) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees; and (3) providing Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise and capacity support to promote international humanitarian law, restore links between lost family members, deliver health services, raise funds for emergency response, and integrate gender equality into operations, among other areas.</description>

    <title>Coordination of Humanitarian Responses in the Middle East – OCHA 2019-2021</title>
    <description>June 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and refugees facing protracted displacement in host countries continue to face acute humanitarian needs in Jordan and Lebanon.  In line with Grand Bargain commitments, GAC is providing flexible regional funding to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on a multiyear basis, for its emergency operations in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Regional funding provides OCHA with the flexibility to allocate funds to better coordinate the humanitarian response to evolving crises across the Middle East. With the support of Canada and other donors, OCHA fulfills its mandate by: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting the assessment and prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Support to the PBF Immediate Response Facility</title>
    <description>This project provides support to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund (UN PBF)’s Immediate Response Facility (IRF). The IRF is providing fast, flexible and relevant funding to countries to help prevent relapse into conflict and sustain peace. The IRF is used in situations where swift action is required for immediate peacebuilding and recovery needs, and allows the UN PBF to respond in a timely manner to crises situations. The IRF also responds to emerging crises and where there are opportunities to support peace processes, typically before other donor funds are available, laying a foundation for the possibility of expanding to medium or long-term support. In addition to countries emerging from conflict or at risk of relapsing into conflict, the IRF is providing funding to countries that are on the agenda of the UN Peacebuilding Commission.</description>

    <title>For a More Inclusive Peace Process in Mali</title>
    <description>This project seeks to contribute to the implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali by making the tools for its implementation—Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), a joint protection force and local police—more participatory, inclusive, and gender and conflict sensitive. The proposed activities aim to meet the needs of local populations in northern regions, Mopti, Kayes and the District of Bamako. This is expected to be accomplished by establishing mechanisms for dialogue and having stakeholders use them to build trust and to support the implementation of joint actions that bring parties together, strengthen social cohesion and prevent violent conflicts.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Emergency Assistance for Conflict-Affected Populations - IOM 2019-2021</title>
    <description>July 2019 – In 2019, there are an estimated 6.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq, 18% of the total population. More than 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced, despite the expulsion of Daesh from Iraqi territory in December 2017. Displaced people both in-camp and out-of-camp settings continue to depend on the provision of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support and the support of other donors, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is leading a multi-sectoral response, which is helping to meet the shelter, health, protection and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs of some of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people in Iraq. These people include internally displaced people (IDPs), recent returnees, and members of host communities.  Project activities include: (1) providing support for shelter and non-food items; (2) providing primary health services; (3) monitoring and addressing protection and psychosocial needs; (4) supporting WASH services; and (5) supporting camp co-ordination and camp management services in IDP camps and informal settlements.</description>

    <title>Support to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund - Phase II</title>
    <description>The United Nations Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) provides support in fragile and conflict affected states by delivering fast, flexible and targeted programming to peace support and peace building initiatives. The PBF is an essential component of the enhanced UN architecture to provide a more sustained engagement in support of countries affected by conflict and instability.  It also supports peacebuilding activities that directly contribute to stabilization and strengthening of state capacity, national and local institutions, and transitional or other authorities. The priorities for the PBF are implementing peace agreements, dialogue and coexistence, peace dividends, and re-establishing basic services.</description>

    <title>Making Waves: Gender-Inclusive Radio-Based Education in the Democratic Republic of Congo</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve learning outcomes for out-of-school children, particularly girls and children with disabilities, in conflict-affected and marginalized communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  The project builds on a four-year pilot project that uses interactive radio instruction (IRI) to reach learners that are unable to participate in the formal school system. In conflict-affected areas, schools are often damaged or used as militia bases, and fear of abduction by armed groups as well as extensive population displacement has led many children to miss out on education or experience disruption in their studies. It is estimated that 7.3 million school-aged children between the ages of 5 and 17, including 3.9 million girls, are out of school.  Project activities include: (1) expanding the curriculum for IRI to include the full cycle of primary school grades; (2) building the capacity of officials from the ministries of Education and Social Affairs, as well as teachers and education assistants, to provide alternative learning services to out-of-school children that are gender-responsive, inclusive, and adapted to crisis and conflict-affected contexts; (3) establishing 10 IRI learning centres in three provinces (South Kivu, Kinshasa and a third province to be determined); (4) studying IRI as a means of delivering gender-responsive alternative education to out-of-school children and children with disabilities, including girls; and (5) conducting mobilization activities led by community members and targeting mothers, fathers, youth and key community actors to promote behavioural change and redefine social norms related to gender, the status of girls and the importance of their education.</description>

    <title>Support to the Immediate Response Account - World Food Programme 2018</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by getting food to the hungry quickly, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Immediate Response Account, WFP is able to respond swiftly to rapid-onset emergencies and protracted crises by providing much-needed up-front funding, and to avoid major pipeline breaks in life-saving operations. Project activities include: (1) providing food assistance; (2) conducting assessments; (3) supporting local and regional markets; (4) providing supplementary feeding for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and female-headed households; and (5) improving logistical and telecommunications support to transport food on ships, planes, helicopters and trucks, to crisis zones.</description>

    <title>Deployment of Canadian Humanitarian Experts - CANADEM 2019-2021</title>
    <description>One of the biggest challenges to the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance is the ability to rapidly deploy experienced humanitarian experts in the aftermath of a disaster. To address this challenge, and to enhance the timeliness, reliability and effectiveness of international humanitarian responses to crises, CANADEM maintains a roster of highly qualified disaster relief and humanitarian experts. These experts can be deployed for short term missions in response to sudden onset emergencies, at the request of United Nations humanitarian agencies.  With GAC's support, CANADEM is managing the deployment of humanitarian experts in response to sudden onset crises abroad. Activities focus on: (1) managing and expanding the humanitarian experts roster, including through ongoing recruitment and skills development of humanitarian experts; and (2) facilitating the short-term deployment of humanitarian experts to UN humanitarian agencies following sudden onset crises, including in the areas of needs assessment and coordination, child protection, water and sanitation, health and nutrition, and information management.</description>

    <title>East Africa Drought - Humanitarian Response - WFP 2019</title>
    <description>June 2019 - Two years after the 2016-2017 drought brought Somalia and parts of Ethiopia to the brink of famine, severe climatic conditions are again pushing the Horn of Africa towards a major humanitarian emergency. Currently, an estimated 11.4 million people are facing acute food insecurity due to drought or displacement in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda. Without immediate humanitarian action, it is estimated that as many as 17 million people across the region could be acutely food insecure as soon as August.  With support from GAC and other international donors, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) is meeting the emergency food assistance and nutrition needs of an estimated 4.7 million drought-affected people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda. Project activities include: (1) the unconditional general distribution of food rations and/or cash or vouchers to help meet basic household food needs; and (2) the provision of supplementary food rations to households with young children at risk of acute malnutrition.</description>

    <title>Equality for Girls' Access to Education in the Nord Kivu and Kasaï Provinces of the DRC</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve access to education for girls and other vulnerable children in the provinces of North Kivu and Kasai in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It addresses the social, financial and gender-specific barriers that prevent them from attending school. It also contributes to improving the capacity of the education system by strengthening the quality and gender sensitivity of formal and informal education services.  In addition, the project aims to increase the capacity of local, provincial and national authorities to provide educational services that meet the needs of girls.  Project activities include: (1) raising community awareness of the importance of education for girls; (2) implementing a music therapy program for girls, young women and women caregivers who have experienced trauma, specifically, sexual and gender-based violence; (3) implementing alternative, traditional and accelerated learning programs for out-of-school girls and other vulnerable children; and (4) updating educational programs and policy at the local and provincial levels by including and/or reinforcing gender and conflict issues.  The project expects to reach 461, 570 people, including 128, 500 girls, 136, 200 women, 70, 000 persons with disabilities and 8, 000 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. School-based activities aim to reach 6,020 girls and 3,904 boys.</description>

    <title>Emergency Assistance - Country-Level Funding - IOM 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - This grant represents Canada's support to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in eight countries, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Venezuela and Yemen. IOM provides humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, migrants, and host communities. IOM provides assistance in multiple sectors, including protection, shelter, emergency non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene services, livelihoods, and camp coordination and management.  With the support of GAC and other donors, IOM is facilitating access to essential relief items and adequate living conditions for crisis-affected populations, including IDPs, refugees, migrants, returnees and host communities.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter kits, non-food items and multi-purpose cash; (2) coordinating camp management for IDPs in United Nations bases; (3) deploying mobile teams to remote locations where affected populations lack water, sanitation and hygiene services; (4) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene; (5) supporting humanitarian organizations by: establishing lightweight camps in deep field locations, heavy base camps and national NGO support centres, and providing cargo transport services; (6) data collection that includes mapping of vulnerable populations at points of entry and at the district and community level for enhanced targeting and delivery of assistance; and (7) protection and gender mainstreaming across humanitarian response activities for extremely vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied migrant children and single women and adolescent girls.</description>

    <title>Democratic Republic of the Congo - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and it is expected that 2020 brings additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDP) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees.  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the DRC Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF). This project represents Canada’s contribution to the DRC CBPF. This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as United Nations agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in the DRC. The CBPF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national NGOs, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Basic service provision is collapsing, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)-managed Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of conflict-affected populations, providing much needed flexibility in a rapidly evolving context. Project activities include: (1) providing needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (2) strengthening the coordination and coherence of humanitarian assistance; (3) funding priority sectors as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (4) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, Health and Protection Assistance - CARE 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 – In 2020, there are an estimated 4.1 million Iraqis in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 1.77 million are in acute need. Out of the 6 million displaced people during the conflict against Daesh, more than 1.4 million remain internally displaced. Those directly affected by the conflict against Daesh, particularly those who were displaced and whose lives and livelihoods were uprooted and destroyed, continue to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, CARE is improving access to essential water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection, and sexual and reproductive health services for up to 60,000 conflict-affected internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in camps, as well as returnees in Ninewa governorate. Project activities include: (1) repairing, rehabilitating and maintaining water and sanitation infrastructure in IDP camps and conflict-affected communities; (2) supporting the delivery of lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services; (3) providing protection response services, including case management, for women, girls, boys and men; and (4) distributing cash transfers to vulnerable returnees in response to urgent protection needs.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Health Response in Lebanon - International Medical Corps 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 - With the Syria crisis in its ninth year, Lebanon continues to host over an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, most of whom reside in host communities. As personal savings erode and needs outpace available international assistance, over 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon now live below the poverty line. Hosting the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide has strained the abilities of local communities to provide essential services, and threatens a delicate balance of peace in the country.  With GAC’s support, the International Medical Corps is providing basic health services to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care assistance including ante- and post-natal care; (2) providing acute illness medications; (3) providing family planning information; (4) providing mental health and psychosocial support; and (5) providing protection case management activities.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Health Support in Lebanon - Tearfund 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 - With the Syria crisis in its ninth year, Lebanon continues to host over an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, most of whom reside in host communities. As personal savings erode and needs outpace available international assistance, over 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon now live below the poverty line. Hosting the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide has strained the abilities of local communities to provide essential services, and threatens a delicate balance of peace in the country.  With GAC’s support, Tearfund is providing basic health services to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing essential primary health care services, including sexual reproductive health (SRH) services; (2) providing training to health care service providers in essential, quality primary health care services and management of non-communicable disease; and (3) providing supplies of essential medicines to clinics.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Women, Peace and Security in Fragile and Conflict-Affected States</title>
    <description>Women’s active participation in conflict prevention, resolution and peacebuilding presents unique and pivotal opportunities to create transformative solutions and, ultimately, more inclusive, gender equal and peaceful societies. This project aims to sustain and strengthen the impact of women peacebuilders and the work of their organizations in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Iraq, Libya, Sri Lanka, Syria and Yemen. The project works to directly support grassroots women’s organizations, through financial support alongside close mentorship and training to strengthen results in their communities. Project activities include: (1) providing grants to local women-led civil society organizations (CSOs) and capacity building to improve the implementation of their projects in fragile and conflict settings; and (2) supporting the development and dissemination of innovative tools and training, increasing the overall capacity of women-led CSOs to contribute toward mediation, peacebuilding, and support to ongoing peace processes.</description>

    <title>Education for Crisis-Affected Girls in Eastern DRC</title>
    <description>The project aims to support the reintegration of child survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) into a safer school system in the conflict-affected and marginalized communities of North and South Kivu in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The project works to improve girls’ access to education and strengthening education systems to be gender-responsive. The project also works to provide immediate psychosocial, emotional and material support to reintegrate child survivors of SGBV into school. The project seeks to tackle harmful gender norms and gender inequality at the household, school and community level by promoting positive gender norms. Project activities include: (1) providing social and emotional support, as well as materials and financial support to 900 SGBV survivors and other vulnerable girls and boys to pursue formal and non-formal education; (2) providing training to 780 education leaders or members of school governance structures (school management committees, parent and student associations) on positive gender norms, and the provision of an inclusive, safe, gender-responsive school environment; (3) improving the capacity of 1,445 teachers (of which 466 are women) to deliver protective, inclusive, gender-responsive instructions to girls, including survivors of SGBV. The project aims to target some 30, 675 direct beneficiaries, including 14, 025 girls and 14, 025 boys between the ages of 6 and 16, and 720 girls and 180 boys survivors of SGBV. The project also aims to reach approximately 87, 600 indirect beneficiaries to receive key messages to raise awareness and strengthen attitudes towards girls’ education.</description>

    <title>Support to the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Post-Conflict in Colombia</title>
    <description>The UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Post-Conflict in Colombia (MPTF) was launched in 2016 in order to support the implementation of the Peace Accord between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Projects funded by the MPTF are delivered by civil society, multilateral organizations, and government authorities.  Canadian funding aims to support the following MPTF thematic programming priorities: (1) Stabilization: strengthening state presence and capacity in municipalities most impacted by the conflict, with the objective of bringing the state to areas where it has been historically absent, reducing inequalities and strengthening security; (2) Victims and Transitional Justice: providing support to authorities in providing collective reparation for victims, by increasing knowledge and capacities to address the differential impacts that the conflict has had on victims due to gender, age, and ethnicity; and (3) Communications: effectively communicate, on a continual basis, on the advances made in implementation of the agreement in order to counter destabilizing messages and promote a culture of peace and reconciliation.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include:  (1) increased government presence and capacity to strengthen security and reduce inequalities in 16 regions in Colombia prioritized by the Regional Transformation Action Plan (RTAP);  (2) increased level of meaningful participation by women (numbers and roles) in MPTF-funded initiatives; and (3)  increased confidence on the part of local communities and individuals most impacted by the conflict that further peace implementation will improve security and living conditions.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2022) include: (1) funded 267 projects in stabilization, reintegration, victims and transitional justice and communications. 42 of these projects aimed at increasing gender equality in these areas; (2) stabilization projects supported the reactivation of territorial working groups on security guarantees, and the creation of advocacy plans and agendas for strengthening participation in the relevant regions. These projects also increased communication with authorities and developed follow-up mechanisms on public policies; (3) strengthened 26 public institutions to provide inclusive and responsive public service delivery; (4) 36 women’s organizations directly received Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) funding to implement gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects; (5) cleared 132.547 square meters of land with explosive remnants of war; and (6) programming funds in the victims and transitional justice sphere strengthened the presence of transitional justice institutions in some territories. MPTF projects increased the interaction between the transitional justice mechanism and other national institutions with human rights mandates. These projects also strengthened the capacity for victims and victims’ organizations to access, participate in, and contribute to the transitional justice mechanism. This increased the mechanism’s ability to protect and guarantee victims’ rights and ensure accountability for conflict-related crimes.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Accelerating Conflict Prevention through Early Warning</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to the prevention, resolution and mitigation of deadly conflict by arming stakeholders and decision-makers with the early information and in-depth analysis they need, in order to take preventative action. This project focuses on the risks of political exclusion and the opportunities for inclusion in different conflicts around the world. The project also works to develop gender-sensitive, thoroughly researched, and pragmatic policy recommendations, and find new ways to promote those ideas with relevant decision-makers and key conflict actors, with a focus on taking action so that they can help bridge the gap between analysis and action.  The project works to devote particular attention to women’s political participation in different stages of conflict and conflict resolution, shedding light on poorly understood gender dynamics in conflict settings, including the shaping of norms and the politicization of societal expectations on men and women.</description>

    <title>Supporting Transitions in Haiti and Darfur from Peacekeeping to Peacebuilding</title>
    <description>This project works to support UN country teams and civil society organizations in Haiti and Sudan to effectively transition from UN peace operations to civilian-led peacebuilding initiatives. In Sudan, this project aims to enhance the local peacebuilding capacities of women and youth, strengthen the rule of law, and support the return of displaced people in Darfur. The project also focuses on consolidating peacebuilding gains in light of the drawdown of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. In Haiti, this project aims to support the transition from the recently concluded United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti to a UN Special Political Mission, with a greater focus on long-term peacebuilding. The project also works to provide technical support to national institutions to help prevent electoral violence against women, strengthen access to justice, support community-violence reduction initiatives, and implement disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programs.</description>

    <title>Prevention, Mitigation and Resolution of Armed Conflict Through Dialogue</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve peace and stability in areas where the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) provides mediation, facilitation and dialogue between government authorities and armed groups. The project works to enable HD to fill a gap in the international field of conflict mediation by engaging with actors on issues that are difficult to reach, through traditional state diplomacy tools, or that fall outside of UN-mandated mediation processes. The project also aims to support the enhanced, meaningful participation of women in peace negotiations, and create inroads for women’s networks and organizations to have an active role in bringing peace to their regions.</description>

    <title>Supporting Leadership, School Retention and the Achievement of Adolescent Girls in Senegal</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to the leadership, retention and success of adolescent girls at the middle and general secondary levels through the integration of gender and child protection in the performance management of institutions and school actors in Senegal. It aims to support the creation of a protective environment for girls, promoting their academic and professional orientation, and to put in place incentives, such as performance contracts including gender indicators, for better accountability for the performance of actors in the education system.  Project activities include the following: (1) supporting educational institutions to include gender in performance management; (2) providing support to educational stakeholders (teachers, institutions, decentralized structures) to make them aware of gender and the protection of adolescent girls in the school system; (3) developing performance contracts and tools for planning, monitoring and managing the performance of educational institutions to integrate the protection approach for adolescent girls in the school system; (4) ensuring awareness among community stakeholders and families on the issues of gender, health and the protection of adolescent girls in the school system, and of encouraging their educational and professional direction; and (5) developing necessary teaching aids.  The project aims to reach 25,000 adolescent girls at the middle and secondary levels, 3,000 professionals in decentralized structures, 640 officers in educational institutions, 1,600 professors and 480 community stakeholders.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Nutrition Assistance - Concern Worldwide 2020-2021</title>
    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 7.5 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.5 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.2 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.4 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system.  With GAC’s support, Concern Worldwide is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition assistance for up to 132,985 displaced and conflict-affected people in Unity  Equatoria state. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating, maintaining or developing 9 water points in the Rubkona and Guit counties of South Sudan; (2) constructing 60 communal latrines, and 100 household latrines in the Bentiu, Guit and Rubkona; and (3) delivering outpatient therapeutic programs, targeted supplementary feeding programs and infant and young child feeding services for 19,974 children and 11,792 pregnant and lactating women across all project sites.</description>

    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 7.5 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.5 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.2 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.4 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system.  With GAC’s support, World Vision Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and protection services for up to 109,243 conflict-affected people in Upper Nile state. Project activities include: (1) supporting 7 SWAT systems and 1 waterpoint as well building latrines in 2 schools; (2) supporting community-based management of acute malnutrition, and providing messaging on Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) best practices to 54,645 people; and (3) reaching 12,000 women, men, boys and girls with gender-based violence services and referral information.</description>

    <title>Girls Retention and Transition Initiative</title>
    <description>This project aims to advance gender equality in education in Tanzania. The project works to address the many barriers preventing girls from enjoying their right to education, through local and national engagement and collaboration with government, schools, and communities. By addressing girls’ education, which is one of the most effective approaches to challenge poverty and inequality, the project works to target the root causes of poverty.  Project activities include: (1) identifying and mentoring girls at risk of dropping out of school; (2) ensuring that girls can access clean, safe toilets, and sanitation facilities and products; (3) raising public awareness and inciting action on issues of girls’ education through multimedia campaigns; and (4) raising government accountability and action through policy dialogue.</description>

    <title>Funding Facility for Stabilization in Iraq - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>The project supports the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) COVID-19 response plan in areas of Iraq that are particularly ill-equipped to manage and/or hardest hit by the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, a portion of Canadian funding to the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS) has been reallocated to support UNDP’s COVID-19 response plan.  UNDP’s COVID-19 response plan seeks to: (1) prevent the spread of COVID-19, manage confirmed cases and save lives; (2) strengthen the Government of Iraq’s (GOI) crisis management and response; and (3) support the GOI in designing post-COVID-19 recovery strategies to address the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.  Project activities include: (1) raising community awareness and sharing official/authorized guidance on COVID-19, including key gender messages, through an online platform; (2) equipping three medical labs with priority medical equipment to strengthen testing capacity; (3) equipping ten healthcare facilities with 180 beds and 180 single-patient airborne infection isolation rooms, in addition to medical furniture/equipment and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers; (4) supporting the United Nations Country Team in Iraq to develop a gender-sensitive post-COVID-19 Recovery Strategy; (5) reaching 25,000 people, particularly women and youth, through social cohesion activities; (6) undertaking three gender-sensitive socio-economic needs and impact assessments, including an assessment on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable groups; and (7) identifying gender-sensitive short- and medium-term recovery strategies for Iraq.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Food Systems in Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the food security and resilience of farmers and rural communities impacted by coronavirus (COVID-19), especially women. The project works to address the COVID-related disruptions in the food system that restrict the functioning of markets, interrupt production and processing, and negatively impact the livelihoods and food security of rural communities. Project activities include: (1) providing gender-equitable and timely agricultural inputs and basic assets for crops, livestock, and fisheries production to small-scale producers; (2) providing logistics, transport, and storage support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, to avoid produce losses, and facilitate access to markets; (3) delivering targeted funds through existing financial institutions working with small-scale producers and small and medium sized enterprises, prioritizing women’s access to appropriate financial services; and (4) utilizing radio, mobile, and digital communication technologies tailored to small-scale women and men farmers, which provide timely information on agricultural markets, weather, production techniques, remote training, and COVID-19 updates.</description>

    <title>Improving Effectiveness of Local Police in Iraq</title>
    <description>The project supports the local Iraqi police forces by training a core group of police trainers from the governorates of Anbar and Ninewah in policing, administration, and management, driven by data and local knowledge (“knowledge-based policing”). The project works to make local police units more responsive to the needs of the local population, through better understanding of local issues, operational planning, and management of resources. The project aims to provide ongoing mentorship to local police officers from these two governorates, including 100 currently active women police officers. The project also works to help refurbish four strategic police stations in both governorates so they can support the implementation of citizen-focused policing in liberated areas.</description>

    <title>Preventing Violent Extremism Through Education in Iraq</title>
    <description>This project aims to build more resilient communities in Iraq from Daesh, in particular the governorates of Anbar and Ninewah, in order to counter the violent and sectarian narratives advanced by Daesh or/and other violent extremist organizations. The project works to provide front-line educators, educational institutions, and parents, with the tools necessary to address the exposure to violent extremism that Iraqi youth had during Daesh control. The project also engages key stakeholders, including women’s organizations, civil society, customary and local governance actors, to participate in efforts to prevent recruitment by violent non-state armed actors and mitigate the risk of radicalization in the two governorates.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Emergency Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance - Cash Consortium for Iraq 2019</title>
    <description>July 2019 – In 2019, there are an estimated 6.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq, 18 % of the total population. More than 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced, despite the expulsion of Daesh from Iraqi territory in December 2017. Displaced people both in-camp and out-of-camp settings continue to depend on the provision of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the Cash Consortium for Iraq (CCI) is providing emergency cash assistance to up to 2,000 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected households in Iraq. This emergency assistance helps families meet critical basic needs and reduce the use of negative coping strategies, while providing dignified choices and supporting local markets. Project activities include: (1) providing multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) transfers to vulnerable households; (2) providing legal support to approximately 270 individuals, to facilitate access to crucial civil documentation and promote linkages with government services; (3) developing and delivering financial literacy training for vulnerable women-headed households; and (4) establishing a mentorship programme to build capacity of two local organizations seeking to use, or already using, MPCA as an emergency response modality.</description>

    <title>Rohingya Crisis - Emergency health and SRHR in Bangladesh - MSF 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, there are approximately 855,000 Rohingya refugees living in 34 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Médecins Sans Frontières is providing emergency health care for refugees and host communities in Cox’s Bazar, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights services. Project activities include: (1) delivering quality and free-of-charge sexual and reproductive health care, including antenatal and postnatal care and family planning for pregnant and lactating women; (2) offering maternity services, neonatal support, paediatric care and 24/7 emergency room services; (3) providing medical treatment for infectious diseases, physical injuries and trauma; and (4) conducting community awareness raising sessions on sexual and reproductive health and sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Lebanon Matching Fund - Humanitarian Coalition 2020</title>
    <description>On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion occurred in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, killing at least 180 people and injuring over 6,500. The explosion took place in the city’s port, which is the largest in the country and the main point of entry for all of Lebanon’s imports, including food and other basic items. The explosion has led to significant disruptions and damage to infrastructure in the Beirut area. The event occurred while Lebanon was already facing a multi-faceted crisis and vulnerable people having limited coping capacities. Priority needs include food assistance, multi-purpose cash and healthcare.  An effective and timely humanitarian assistance response is essential to address the immediate life-saving needs of the affected people. In order to respond to this crisis, Global Affairs Canada launched the Lebanon Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Through this mechanism, the Government of Canada is matching the eligible donations made to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members, up to $8 million.  The funds are used by Humanitarian Coalition members to deliver life-saving assistance to those most in need such as emergency food, cash, health, protection, shelter, and water, sanitation and hygiene services.</description>

    <title>Back to School Better: Increasing Gender-Responsive Education for Refugee and Displaced Girls</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase gender equality and promote the empowerment of refugee and displaced girls in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Mali. This project works to address the barriers to the personal safety of girls, as well as the systemic/cultural barriers they face to realizing their right to education in the context of coronavirus (COVID-19). Project activities include: (1) conducting community outreach on the importance of refugee and displaced girls’ education and sexual and gender-based violence prevention; (2) providing support to gender-responsive enrollment campaigns to refugee and displaced girls; (3) supporting safe learning spaces for girls; (4) providing gender-responsive technical assistance to education stakeholders on integrating refugee and displaced girls in post-COVID-19 education plans; (5) providing training to teachers and social workers on gender-responsive remote learning and psycho-social support for refugee and displaced girls; and (6) providing hygiene and menstrual health kits to girls in formal and non-formal learning spaces.  The project expects to directly benefit 58,950 girls and adolescent girls who are internally displaced or refugees, and 15,000 vulnerable host community girls between the ages of 3 and 19. The project also expects to indirectly benefit 750,350 community members, 1,000 community-based organizations, including women’s associations, 250 school management committee members, 31,200 teachers, 5,000 boys, and officials from the Ministries of Education.</description>

    <title>Girls’ Education in Conflict-affected Areas in Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project addresses the barriers that prevent girls between the ages of 6 and 14 from attending and staying in school in targeted regions in Nigeria.  The project improves girls' access to education by: 1) engaging with decision-makers in households as well as community and religious leaders; and 2) providing conditional financial support through vouchers and cash transfers to vulnerable households to enrol 10,000 girls and keep them in school.  The project improves the quality of schools by: 1) recruiting and training 180 volunteer teachers, particularly women, within communities and transitioning them to the government payroll; 2) supporting 60 school improvement plans to make them more girl-friendly; and 3) training 600 teachers on gender-responsive teaching and classroom management.  The main beneficiaries are 29,042 girls aged 6-14, with a particular focus on internally displaced persons, out-of-school girls, and married adolescent girls. The project also benefits 24,108 boys aged 6-14.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved effectiveness of women's organizations to actively represent and support women's voices in decision-making processes; (2) increased participation by women in the local economy, particularly in the solid waste management sector; and (3) enhanced gender-informed and responsive policy-making in solid waste management at community and national levels.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2023) include: (1) improved the effectiveness of 10 community-based organizations (CBOs) and 2cooperatives to actively represent and support women’s voices in decision-making. Through campaigns, workshops, and training sessions involving both men and women, the community gained awareness about gender-based issues and women's rights increased. Also, 84 women from 10 CBOs, 2cooperatives and 7 women from the Ministry of Local Administration, received training, enhancing their skills for better participation in decision-making. Gender considerations became a focal point of integration into policy-making processes across 10 CBOs and 2 cooperatives in 4 municipalities, meeting the target of 12 organizations; (2) 1,080 women engaged in 10 green businesses run by CBOs, such as aquaponics farms and food repurposing, setting the foundation for improving their wellbeing and quality of life. Through their involvement in this initiative, women reported increased self-confidence and independence and increased engagement in household and community-level decision-making. Also, 80 women took part in the health awareness campaign during COVID 19. The project benefited 1000 women who joined its various   intervention. These women are part of the 10 green business group projects: Ruwwad Al Aghwar Cooperative in Northern Shouneh, which manages the Sorting Facility; and Tubneh Cooperative in Deir Abi Saed, which manages the Compositing Plant and Sorting Facility; and (3) enhanced gender-informed and responsive policy-making in 10 CBOs and 2cooperatives in 4 municipalities by supporting them to develop and implement initiatives that specifically address gender issues, particularly in solid waste management and the circular economy. The project also strengthened government’s capacity to integrate gender equality considerations into the national strategy and action plans for solid waste management.  It did so by training and engaging 120 officials from the municipalities, Joint Service Commission, and Ministry of Local Administration and 80 community participants.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Enhancing Mother, Newborn and Child Health - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project works to respond to the threat of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Cambodia and the Philippines, by reducing or preventing local COVID-19 transmission and the disproportionate gender effects of COVID-19 on women and girls at the household, community, and structural level in Cambodia and the Philippines.  Project activities include: (1) providing support to individuals, especially women and girls, to gain access and control over the practical resources necessary for their health and well-being during the pandemic, such as personal protective equipment, psychosocial support, food and financial support kits, and materials for menstrual hygiene for those in quarantine or isolation; (2) supporting vulnerable households who have lost their livelihoods, through counseling and mediation assistance to extend loans and delay repayment schedules, as well as provide supports to assist with continuity of farming and fishing, and provide targeted cash transfers and/or nutritional food assistance kits; (3) supporting the continuity of life saving health services, such as sexual reproductive health and rights and gender-based violence services and family care needs; (4) raising public awareness with local partners on matters related to COVID-19, sexual and reproductive health, and gender-based violence via radio, information education and communication materials, social media, SMS blasts and loudspeaker; and (5) building the capacity of institutions to reduce transmission and respond to the gender specific needs of those impacted by the pandemic.  This project expects to reach 106,535 people. This project also provides border quarantine support, which contributes to protecting an estimated total population of 3,005,018 people.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Healthcare for Conflict and Displacement-Affected People - MdM 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 – there are an estimated 4.1 million Iraqis in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 1.77 million are in acute need. Out of the 6 million displaced people during the conflict against Daesh, more than 1.4 million people remain internally displaced. Those directly affected by the conflict against Daesh, particularly those who were displaced and whose lives and livelihoods were uprooted and destroyed, continue to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Médecins du Monde is providing a comprehensive healthcare response to meet the immediate lifesaving needs of conflict-affected persons in Iraq, including internally displaced persons, returnees, and host communities. This intervention aims to reach up to 130,000 individuals. Project activities include: (1) supporting the provision of the Basic Health Service package, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS); (2) providing medical and MHPSS services to survivors of gender-based violence (GBV); (3) providing logistical support to primary health care centres, including essential equipment and supplies; (4) providing training to national health service providers on Basic Health Service package, including on SRH, MHPSS, and referrals; and (5) providing training in coordination with local health authorities on GBV prevention and response.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance to Vulnerable People in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a leader of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over nine years into the conflict, an estimated 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian need and millions remain internally displaced throughout the region. These years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide emergency health, nutrition and protection services for up to 560,000 people. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, including modern methods of contraception; (2) providing services to survivors or persons at risk of sexual and gender-based violence; (3) providing health services to pregnant women and severely malnourished children; and (4) training healthcare providers in the delivery of SRH services.</description>

    <title>Educating Vulnerable and Hard-to-Reach Women and Girls in Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project addresses the barriers that often prevent girls and women from attending and staying in school in targeted regions of Nigeria.  The project improves girls' access to education by: providing: (1) 2,500 vouchers targeted to vulnerable adolescent girls to cover school fees; (2) conducting enrolment campaigns; and (3) engaging traditional community and religious leaders on girls’ education.  The project improves the quality of schools by: (1) establishing accelerated learning programs for 5,700 students (2,850 girls; 2,850 boys); (2) training teachers on gender-responsive pedagogy; and (3) supporting school-based management committees and local education authorities to implement action plans to make schools safer and more girl-friendly based on girls’ feedback.  The main beneficiaries are 25,203 girls and 23,419 boys from 10 to 19 years old taught through informal and formal schools; 700 teachers (of which half are women) of both formal and informal schools; 700 traditional and religious leaders; and 120 education government officials.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Populations at Risk of Gender-Based Violence - UNFPA 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 – Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is helping to reduce the vulnerability of people, predominantly women and girls, in the West Bank and Gaza to all forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and from the threat of such violence. This project is expected to increase access by GBV survivors to gender-responsive GBV services, strengthen capacity to develop and implement institutional frameworks that promote and protect GBV survivors, and support the positive role of youth in combating GBV through community initiatives and campaigns designed and implemented by youth innovative approaches. Project activities include: (1) upgrading or equipping safe spaces for women and girls in the West Bank and Gaza; (2) enhancing the skills of 120 service providers to be able to safely, effectively, and ethically perform their duties, including case management based on the developed standard operations procedures in targeted areas in the West Bank and Gaza; (3) enhancing the capacity of social counselors to provide long-term psychosocial support services to 800 GBV survivors; (4) providing vocational and life skills activities and support for innovative income generating initiatives for survivors of GBV to respond to basic household needs and build resilience; and (5) conducting policy dialogue and taking action on how to strengthen the effectiveness of the referral system for GBV cases.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased capacity for women and girls from communities and institutions to promote and exercise their voice and agency related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); (2) increased access to comprehensive gender response SRHR services for women and girls; and (3) improved access to healthcare assistance and referrals for women and girls from host communities and Venezuelan migrants who are survivors of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.  </expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2021 include: (1) provided comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services to 5,300 migrants, refugees and host community members (of which 4,430 women and 444 girls); (2) reached 20,299 beneficiaries (of which 11,325 women and 1,744 girls) through SRHR campaigns; and (3) delivered training and campaign information in health centres. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a big challenge for the project’s implementation. The International Organization for Migration started delivering the training and campaign information in these health centres because they were among the few places allowed to open. This led to further training and support for health centre staff to assist on SRHR.  Results achieved in Colombia and Ecuador as of the end of the project (September 2021) include: (1) 63,442 women, girls and other beneficiaries participated in gender promotion activities on sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR); (2) 11,384 beneficiaries reported having access to gender-sensitive SRHR assistance; and (3) 1,240 medical and non-medical service providers learned about the principles guiding gender-based violence (GBV), including support towards women and girls, survivors and referrals of GBV; and (4) the project contributed to 14,483 women, girls, migrants, refugees and host communities access to quality health services. These services, far exceeded the original target of 13,600, covering gender, sexual and reproductive health and rights.</resultsAchieved>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthened gender-responsive policies and differentiated mechanism for the identification and protection of children, especially girls; (2) enhanced alternative care systems adapted to the differentiated needs of unaccompanied, separated, and highly vulnerable migrant girls, boys and adolescents; and (3) strengthened gender-responsive interventions to address sexual and gender-based violence towards girls, boys and adolescents.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2020 include: (1) increased technical protection response for migrants. Mainly increased the development of mechanisms for children crossing borders, to provide more adequate care, including shelter, within the overall child protection systems; (2) established, in Colombia, drop-in centres and strengthened a national route to support family reunification; trained local government personnel in Colombia on how to respond to gender-based violence (GBV) in a migratory context and developed a community model for prevention of GBV; supported the Colombian National Protection Agency for Children in strengthening its work with the creation of a new migration work unit; (3) established, in Ecuador, comprehensive support spaces to provide psychosocial support, legal aid and referral to specialised services to migrant girls and boys; also ensured care homes are also available, especially for unaccompanied adolescents in transit and primarily to provide assistance in family reunification; (4) laid the ground work, in Peru, for an alternative care system for unaccompanied children, including shelter care and training on case management; and (5) reached more children than anticipated, including at least 4,681 girls, adolescent girls and boys (against a target of 2,500 children reached) in receiving specialized attention in the three countries; assisted 1,100 unaccompanied minors in some of the alternative care modalities.  Results achieved as of December 2021 include: (1) 1,174 unaccompanied girls and boys received specialized attention under protection systems; (2) 8,602 girls and boys accessed quality services through differentiated sexual gender based violence strategies and tools; and (3) six public guidelines were generated by the authorities in the three countries. UNICEF offered technical assistance for protection response that met the needs of migrants and refugees within the countries.  In Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, the project benefited 10,601 girls, and adolescent girls and boys on the move. The three countries’ national child protection systems gave specialized attention to gender-responsive interventions. The number of beneficiaries far exceeded the original target of 2,500.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Gender-Responsive WASH and Health Assistance to Conflict-Affected Populations in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide emergency health, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services to up to 313,000 persons.

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Food Insecure Non-Refugee Palestinians - WFP 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP) helps enhance individual and household access to adequate and nutritious food in the West Bank and Gaza. Project activities include: (1) distributing in-kind food assistance to food-insecure households, including women-headed households; (2) providing electronic vouchers to food-insecure households in urban areas, which supports the local economy and has a positive impact on household food consumption, dietary diversity, and autonomy to make food choices; and (3) offering nutrition awareness sessions to empower women and improve nutritional health and knowledge.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Education for Children and internally displaced in host communities in Ethiopia</title>
    <description>This project aimed to provide safe and protective learning opportunities to approximately 30,000 girls and boys (50 percent girls) in internally displaced people/IDP sites and host communities in Afar (8,250), Oromiya (15,000), and the State of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNPR) (6,750).  During the project implementation period, factors beyond the partners` control prevented the complete implementation of planned activities. Persistent insecurity and access constraints caused by armed conflicts in some of the target areas, particularly in Afar and SNNPR contributed to a partial implementation of the project. Due to these factors, the project only reached some of  the targeted children.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) enhanced equitable provision of accessible, safe, secure, quality, inclusive education and mental health and psycho-social support for girls and boys. This includes accelerated learning and skills for employment training in internally displaced and in Ethiopian host communities affected by COVID-19; and (2) reduced barriers preventing girls’ access to and retention in quality education in internally displaced and in Ethiopian host communities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2022) include: (1) provided 25,612 out-of-school children (48% girls) access to accelerated learning programme and skills training linked with child protection services in Afar, Oromia and the State of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNPR). This indicates that UNICEF achieved 85.4% against its target of 30,000 children. Persistent insecurity and access constraints due to armed conflicts in some of the target areas, particularly in Afar and SNNPR prevented the implementation of some project activities. Due to these challenges, the project could not reach the targeted number of children. Despite the volatile operational context, UNICEF’s partners (Edukans Foundation in Afar, Imagine 1 Day in Oromia and SNNPR) have continued to conduct remote monitoring and deliver project results, participate in regional Cluster and Inter-Cluster fora in respective regions, coordinate with government authorities, and prioritize staff safety and well-being.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to COVID-19 Prevention, Surveillance and Containment in Mozambique</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve Mozambique’s public health sector knowledge, capacity, and surge response for forecasting/modelling, testing, diagnosis, contact tracing, and public health policy formulation to reduce mortality and morbidity from the COVID-19 pandemic. This project provides technical assistance, seconded staff and financial assistance to Mozambique’s National Health Institute to support COVID-19 prevention and containment. Project activities include: (1) modelling and forecasting disease; (2) procuring testing kits and establishing “walk-thru” testing centres in high-risk communities with COVID-19 outbreaks; (3) providing infection control/prevention by augmenting contact tracing, transporting test samples for processing and rapid diagnostics (the latter when available); and (4) providing health worker support, including training and personal protective equipment.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased effectiveness of the Government of Mozambique's response with sensitivity to vulnerable populations, including women who bear a unique burden in the face of the pandemic; and (2) improved responsiveness and gender-sensitivity of health system planning and policies adequately adapted to the Mozambican context, ensuring the Mozambique government is responsive to the evolving pandemic with the latest evidence and technology to best serve its population and high-risk groups.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2023 include: (1) Mozambique recorded 233,731 positive cases. They reported only 388 new cases since March 27, 2023, showing a significant slowdown in new infections; (2) administrated over 34 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in Mozambique, fully vaccinating 68% of the population and exceeded its target for priority groups; (3) successfully expanded testing, with all provinces offering both types of COVID-19 tests. They conducted 1,454,915 tests. They also adopted 2 new quick tests after successful evaluations; (4) established 8 walk-thru centers in busy areas, providing testing at 3 main transport hubs and 4 open-air markets. They tested 34,888 people, 55% women. These centers also helped identify 6,394 people with high-risk health conditions. The Ministry of Health found these centers effective and plans to use them for future community testing; and (5) the National Institute of Health (INS) expanded its public health labs and sentinel sites (places that monitor disease) to 7 provinces.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Vital Statistics in Support of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase civil registration rates. This increase in the budget for the project accelerates birth and death registration, expands the reach of registration services to health centres, and ensures the development of a more accessible and gender-responsive system. Project activities include: (1) establishing a legislative and regulatory framework to support the new civil registration system with clearly defined roles and responsibilities of each government institution; (2) providing training to key actors on the new civil registration system, including on gender-sensitive procedures; and (3) equipping and preparing health units (28 hospitals, 287 health centres and 11 provincial health departments) to  provide registration services.</description>

    <title>Ghana Paediatric Nursing Education Partnership</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce death and illness among newborns and children in underserved districts in Ghana. By expanding paediatric nurse programs, this project seeks to build the professional skills of paediatric nurses and health workers to provide quality, cost-effective, evidence-based nursing and midwifery care to newborns and children. This project is providing additional funds in response to the immediate needs of the COVID-19 pandemic for enhanced access to quality healthcare, strengthening education and awareness and demystifying rumours of COVID-19.  Project activities include: (1) expanding COVID-19 related training across Ghana to all levels of the health system; (2) enhancing the knowledge and skills of nurses and other health workers in delivering health care during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) ensuring health workers are equipped and continue to provide routine care to children and families in a safe manner; and (4) leading of outreach activities by clinical leaders and change agents, and graduate nurses, who are trusted in their communities.  The project expects to reach about 1,500 people, including nurses, midwives and health workers, directly with training. Approximately 6,700,000 children and newborns are also expected to benefit from better health services as a result of the scale-up of paediatric nursing programs in Ghana. The COVID-19 related activities are expected to directly benefit 86,660 people (including 65,495 females) and indirectly benefit 3.6 million citizens of Ghana as a result of health care workers receiving and delivering COVID-19 specific training.</description>

    <title>Southern African Nutrition Initiative - Phase II - COVID-19 Response</title>
    <description>This project aims to lessen the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on poor and marginalized communities in targeted areas of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. Aligned with national pandemic response plans, this project works to help reduce the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable people, particularly women and girls, by improving nutrition and food security resilience among households and communities, and strengthening community-level sexual and gender-based violence prevention and response mechanisms.  Project activities include: (1) 6,250 farm households  in Zambia and in Mozambique are receiving training and support through Farmer Field Business Schools to improve farming practices and marketing skills, leading to increased food security and strengthened livelihoods; (2) 200 households in Mozambique at greatest risk of severe malnutrition are receiving a cash transfer package so that they can purchase essential food; (3) 620 Village Savings and Loans Associations in Malawi and Zambia are being strengthened and expanded to support women’s income generating activities; (4) Community Health Workers are being supported to conduct nutritional status detection, monitoring and treatment to reduce the incidence of malnutrition among women of reproductive age and children under 5YOA; (5)  linkages between health care workers and community health workers are being strengthened to improve the delivery of survivor-centred support and referral to services; (6) training and awareness on issues related to gender inequality, SRHR and positive masculinities are being conducted with community health workers, local faith and opinion leaders, young people, and parents.  This phase of CARE Canada's COVID-19 response expects to directly benefit 61,900 women, girls, men, and boys in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. This project also expects to indirectly benefit an additional 286,550 women, men, girls and boys.</description>

    <title>Gender Responsive Education and Skills Program in Chittagong Hill Tracts</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve learning outcomes and employability for vulnerable and low-income Indigenous and Bengali girls,  adolescent women and women, including the disabled, in Bandarban and Rangamati in the Chittagong Hill Tracts district of Bangladesh. Project activities include: (1) improving access to quality learning for dropouts and providing gender-responsive subject matter training to teaching assistants to teach dropouts in their indigenous language and bridge them into primary school; (2) reducing gender-based violence to ensure safe and secure communities and institutions, education administration and training officials to recognize signs of harassment; (3) developing  adolescent women’s leadership skills to set up co-curricular activities in secondary schools; (4) establishing community watch groups to prevent child marriage, gender based-violence and sexual harassment; (5) enhancing employment skills, training girls and women on market-driven trades followed by job placement and informing employers on best practices creating decent work environment; and (6) raising community leaders’ awareness on  the benefits of women’s participation in the labour market.  This project expects to benefit 30,000 indigenous and Bengali primary school students and 15,000 secondary students. Also, this project is estimated to reach 410 teaching assistants and 50 school management committees; and 1,230 women and men participate in skills training supported by 375 master crafts persons.</description>

    <title>Chad - Integrated Humanitarian Response in Lac Province - Oxfam-Québec 2021-2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 — Chad is facing interconnected humanitarian crises in a context of chronic poverty and limited development. The security situation in neighbouring countries is still contributing to the sporadic movement of people to Chad, particularly to the southern part of the country for people coming from the Central African Republic, to the eastern part of the country for people coming from Sudan, and internal displacements in Lac province in the western part of the country. In this context, it is estimated that close to 6.9 million people will need emergency humanitarian assistance in 2023. Moreover, malnutrition continues to grow as a result of the harmful effects of the COVID 19 pandemic, which is contributing to a worsening of the malnutrition situation and is leading to health problems.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam-Québec is meeting the urgent needs of approximately 59 357 people who are affected by conflict in Lac province. Project activities include: (1) building 8 sources of water and 370 family latrines, which will benefit  38 040 people; (2) building 12 care rooms, including 2 delivery rooms; (3) distributing 2 243 sanitary kits and 2,100 female dignity kits; (4) distributing 1,500 child care and hygiene kits to malnourished mother and child pairs; (5) implementing a referral system that will reach 65% of male and female survivors of gender based violence in order to guide them to appropriate services; and (6) organizing 10 education sessions on health rights, particularly relating to sexual and reproductive health.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased and safe access to drinking water and sanitation facilities; (2) increased ability of health centres to provide meaningful primary care that is adapted to the needs of vulnerable communities; (3) increased use of effective and appropriate hygiene practices; (4) enhanced access to prevention and treatment of malnutrition, particularly in children suffering from acute malnutrition; (5) easier access to protection services; and (6) greater knowledge among women and girls from displaced populations and their hosts about their health rights, particularly regarding sexual and reproductive health.  The expected ultimate outcome is lives saved, suffering alleviated and human dignity maintained in countries experiencing humanitarian crises or acute food insecurity.</expectedResults>

    <title>Least Developed Countries Fund -  Institutional Support 2020-2024</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada's long-term institutional support to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). The LDCF uses these funds, along with other donors’ funding, to achieve its mandate: to adress the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries. The LDCF provides support to least developed countries for the preparation and implementation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).  Consistent with the needs of recipient countries, the LDCF focuses on reducing the vulnerability of the sectors and resources that are central to development and livelihoods, notably: agriculture and food security; health; water; disaster risk management and prevention; infrastructure; and fragile ecosystems.  The LDCF is mandated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Operating under the Global Environment Facility, it addresses the needs of the 47 least developed countries that are especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.</description>

    <expectedResults>The LDCF aims to achieve three key results: (1) reduce the vulnerability and increase resilience of LDCs through innovation and technology transfer for climate change adaptation; (2) mainstream climate change adaptation and resilience for systemic impact; and (3) foster enabling conditions for effective and integrated climate change adaptation. These results cut across a wide variety of themes and geographies, including, for example: improving resilience of the agriculture sector in East Africa; supporting distribution of drought-resilient crop seeds in Sub-Saharan Africa; and investing in automated weather stations to help increase food and water security in Pacific Small Islands Developing States.</expectedResults>

    <title>India Humanitarian Response  – International Federation of the Red Cross COVID-19 Appeal</title>
    <description>April 2021 – Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in India have grown exponentially to over 17 million, with daily cases increasing from around 10,000 at the beginning of February 2021 to more than 350,000 by the end of April. According to the WHO Health Emergency Dashboard, on April 27 alone, India officially recorded over 2,700 deaths due to COVID-19. However, excess deaths attributable to the virus were likely many times this figure. This second wave has overwhelmed health infrastructure across the country. In major cities like Mumbai and Delhi, there are severe shortages of ICU hospital beds, medical oxygen and medications to treat COVID-19. Hospitals are overcrowded and turning away patients.  Hospitalization facilities, human resources capacity, bedding availability, and ambulance services are in high demand. A growing number of Indian states have implemented lockdowns.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross will support the Indian Red Cross in responding to urgent needs brought on by the most recent wave of the pandemic. Project activities include: (1) providing health supplies and equipment to affected medical facilities and communities to bolster the health system’s response; (2) expanding health service provision; and (3) implementing risk communication and hygiene promotion activities within the community.</description>

    <title>Girls access to education with school canteens in Burkina Faso</title>
    <description>This project aims to offer school feeding activities to help systematically eliminate barriers related to educating students, especially girls, in high-priority regions of Burkina Faso, namely, Sahel, Boucle du Mouhoun, Nord, Centre-Nord and Est. This project works to improve access, retention, gender equality, equity and protection of children, particularly for girls.  Project activities include: 1) the implementation of regular school feeding programs, but also emergency school feeding programs to meet the growing needs of host communities and thousands of displaced people; 2) distribution of 3,300 tons of food to 60,000 students, mostly girls, to provide them with a hot meal; 3) serve morning breakfasts with take-home rations to nearly 5,000 girls. The provision of take-home rations is intended to encourage parents to keep their daughters in school until the end of primary school, reducing, among other things, the risk of early marriage and pregnancy.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Shelter and Protection Response - Danish Refugee Council 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 – In 2020, there are an estimated 4.1 million Iraqis in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 1.77 million are in acute need. Out of the 6 million people displaced during the conflict against Daesh, more than 1.4 million people remain internally displaced. Those directly affected by the conflict against Daesh, particularly those who were displaced and whose lives and livelihoods were uprooted and destroyed, continue to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) is implementing a cross-sectoral shelter and housing, land and property (HLP) intervention that aims to contribute to addressing critical shelter vulnerabilities, targeting up to 11,000 conflict- and displacement-affected individuals, experiencing the most acute vulnerabilities, particularly women-headed households. Project activities include: (1) repairing or rehabilitating critical war-damaged shelters; (2) providing legal assistance with accessing civil documentation and HLP rights; and (3) repairing and rehabilitating basic community infrastructure in areas severely affected by the conflict.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People and Returnees in Somalia - CARE 2021-2022</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Despite progress towards sustainable political stability, the impact of more than three decades of insecurity, exacerbated by frequently recurring drought, increasing seasonal flooding, an ongoing historic infestation of desert locusts, and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, has left much of the population without access to basic services and ever more vulnerable to the next shock. Internal displacement remains at record levels, with an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) living in more than 2,400 sites across the country, and severe food insecurity is projected to increase in 2021, as a La Niña weather event is expected to bring renewed drought conditions early in the year. Altogether, an estimated 5.9 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, CARE is improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services and helping households meet essential needs amongst internally displaced persons, returnees, and host communities in Somalia’s drought- and conflict-affected Lower Juba region. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water points and distributing water and sanitation related non-food items in IDP communities; and (2) providing unconditional cash grants to vulnerable IDP, returnee, and host community households.</description>

    <title>Emergency Drawdown Fund -– ICRC  Appeals CAP 2021</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect people’s lives and dignity affected by conflict and other violent situation. The ICRC assists and prevents further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.  With GAC’s support, the Emergency Drawdown Fund promotes early, effective, and timely humanitarian actions to respond to sudden-onset crises of significant humanitarian proportions, mainly through the provision of life-saving activities such as health care, protection services, emergency shelter, including water, sanitation and hygiene services. This new funding mechanism enables the organization to be more responsive and timely in response to sudden-onset crisis to save more lives while minimizing transaction costs.  Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise to strengthen their capacity in areas such as promoting international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and delivering relief in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of detainees and civilians not taking part in hostilities.</description>

    <title>Advancing Quality Education and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights - FASE COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project contributes to the joint donor Education Sector Support Fund (FASE) to respond to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the national education system in Mozambique. FASE funds support Mozambique’s Ministry of Education and Human Development in providing children and adults with access to quality education and literacy programs so that they learn and succeed. This project provides additional funds to the Ministry to implement specific activities of its COVID-19 Response Plan during the 2021 academic year. Project activities include: (1) sensitizing school communities on COVID-19 symptoms, forms of transmission, and prevention and control measures; (2) adjusting teaching and learning methods to enable schooling to continue, including using radio, television and online distance-learning programs and providing psychosocial and violence prevention programs; and (3) promoting the safe return to school by ensuring access to water, sanitation and hygiene to meet COVID-19 prevention measures and the needs of girls and children with special needs.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Response - ACF 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 – In 2020, there are an estimated 4.1 million Iraqis in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 1.77 million are in acute need. Out of the 6 million displaced people during the conflict against Daesh, more than 1.4 million people remain internally displaced. Those directly affected by the conflict against Daesh, particularly those who were displaced and whose lives and livelihoods were uprooted and destroyed, continue to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger provides a mental health and psychosocial support response to meet the immediate lifesaving needs of conflict-affected persons in Iraq, including internally displaced persons, returnees, and host communities. This intervention aims to target up to 13,000 vulnerable individuals exhibiting symptoms relating to mental health issues and psychological distress. Project activities include: (1) providing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services through awareness sessions, support groups, and clinical trauma treatment for individuals and groups; (2) providing referrals and case management to individuals who have experienced gender-based violence and/or severe mental health problems; (3) providing MHPSS training to health workers, teachers and community leaders; and (4) providing training and support on emergency child care practices to pregnant and lactating women, health workers and community leaders.</description>

    <title>Iraq Crisis - Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Protection Assistance - Oxfam-Québec 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 – In 2020, there are an estimated 4.1 million Iraqis in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 1.77 million are in acute need. Out of the 6 million displaced people during the conflict against Daesh, more than 1.4 million people remain internally displaced. Those directly affected by the conflict against Daesh, particularly those who were displaced and whose lives and livelihoods were uprooted and destroyed, continue to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam-Québec provides water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection assistance to vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and host communities in Iraq. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water supply systems and water treatment plants; (2) providing sanitation facilities and solid and medical waste management systems in health centres; (3) delivering hygiene promotion activities; (4) providing emergency cash-for-protection grants or multi-purpose cash assistance to vulnerable women-headed households; (5) providing psychosocial support activities; and (6) providing training to community-based structures, including women and youth groups, on protection monitoring, case identification, and referrals.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Global Food Crisis  - Emergency Response - ICRC 2021</title>
    <description>August 2021 - Prior to the onset of the coronavirus  (COVID-19), humanitarian needs, including those related to food security, had already reached unprecedented levels. The pandemic has exacerbated the situation by disrupting food production, supply and distribution; destabilizing food prices; and reducing country and/or consumer purchasing power. According to the July 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, in 2020 the world experienced the single largest increase in global hunger ever recorded, with as many as 160 million additional people falling deeper into hunger. This trend has only continued into 2021. In Africa in particular, hunger affects 21% of the population.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is scaling up its response to the global food crisis, including through adapting its programs to address the needs and challenges related to food insecurity in conflict settings. The ICRC is coordinating with the rest of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and National Societies, to support a local and global response to the food crisis.  With GAC’s support, the ICRC is working to ensure assistance, including food assistance, reaches the most difficult-to-access populations, in crisis- and conflict-affected contexts. Project activities include: (1) distributing nutritional supplements for the prevention of malnutrition to households with children aged six to twenty-three months; (2) providing supplementary food rations (super cereal plus) to pregnant and lactating women who visit ICRC-supported primary health care facilities; and (3) working with vulnerable farmers, livestock-keeping communities and other affected populations (including internally displaced peoples, returnees and residents) on sustainable solutions to increase their level of production.</description>

    <title>Critical gender-sensitive support to vulnerable conflict and pandemic-affected households in Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project responds to the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on conflict-affected communities in Northeast Nigeria, especially on women and girls. To do so, the project will mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the nutrition, livelihoods, and protection of women and girls by increasing the availability and equitable access to agricultural inputs and nutritious foods, empowering women through income-generating activities and agricultural livelihoods, and protecting women and girls from increased exploitation risks during fuel collection. Project activities include the provision of training and inputs to men and women on to improve agricultural livelihoods and nutrition, as well as supporting economic opportunities for women in cereal, fish, and eco-stove production facilities. Women-only Village, Savings, and Loans Groups will be established in communities to encourage business development and savings.  Finally, women will be provided with eco-friendly fuel resources to reduce exposure to sexual and gender based violence risks associated with fuel collection. This project aims to benefit 28,450 households across Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States.</description>

    <title>Support to the National Aid Fund (NAF) in Jordan</title>
    <description>This project supports Jordan’s National Aid Fund (NAF) efforts to meet the needs of poor and vulnerable families in Jordan. This project provides short-term assistance to families who are below the poverty line due to the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes long-term support to existing beneficiaries of NAF’s social assistance programs. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency cash assistance to vulnerable Jordanian households affected by the crisis; and (2) providing technical assistance to help build the NAF’s capacity to integrate gender equality considerations into their programs and strengthen monitoring and evaluation and other gender equality aspects.  As with all pooled funded projects, Canada collaborates with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization and strengthen mutual accountability. This type of assistance fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, strengthening efforts for effective focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors.</description>

    <title>Women in Peace Operations – Zambia</title>
    <description>This project aims to provide training equipment and support to the Zambia Police Service (ZPS), especially its Police Women’s Network, in mitigating key barriers to women’s meaningful participation identified in the Measuring Opportunities for Women in Peace Operations (MOWIP) barrier assessment. In 2020, the ZPS became the first service in the world to complete a barrier assessment using the innovative MOWIP methodology supported by Canada.  As part of the bilateral partnership between Canada and Zambia under the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, this equipment enables training and complements other capacity-building under the Elsie Initiative, including technical assistance from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This project also supports the Zambian Police Women’s Network to disseminate the results of the barrier assessment, advocate women’s perspectives, implement mitigation strategies, and disseminate new policies to increase the number of ZPS women deployed to UN peace operations.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of the project include: (1) improved actions taken by authorities and civil society, for greater effectiveness in addressing the root causes of conflict and spoilers to peace in conflict-affected regions; (2) enhanced understanding by state authorities of the conditions and conflict dynamics in the regions where the MAPP operates; (3) increased access for civil society organizations and victims, including women and girls of different ethnicities, to truth, reconciliation, justice and other peacebuilding processes; and (4) strengthened trust between conflict-affected communities, civil society and the state.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2021 include : (1) 35 Colombian women increased their leadership skills and abilities to participate in senior positions in the public service; (2) increased capacity of local civil society and survivors of the conflict to document cases of sexual and gender-based violence for present to the Special Jurisdiction for Peace; (3) increased understanding by Colombian authorities on risks faced by rural communities, including Indigenous populations, in giving urgency to protection measures and actions; (4) increased recognition by authorities of the range of gender and prejudice-based violence during the conflict; (5) improved communications, awareness and solidarity by Indigenous Wayuu and Afro-Colombian women on commonalities of conflict-related experiences. This was made possible through joint testimony gathering exercises supported by the Mission to Support the Peace Process (MAPP) and the Truth Commission; (6) improved culturally and gender-appropriate processes adopted by the Truth Commission to work with ethnic victims of the conflict; and (7) increased knowledge and understanding of risk scenarios by authorities complimenting early warning emissions.</resultsAchieved>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved community response to and recovery from COVID-19 that include specific measures for women, girls and those experiencing marginalization or vulnerability; and (2) increased equitable coverage of public health and health care services for people infected with and/or affected by COVID-19.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (January 2023) include: (1) reached a total of 681,621 community members exceeding targeted results by 15%; (2) reached 353,117 community members in Bangladesh (137,189 women/girls and 215,928 men/boys). Religious leaders and influencers served as role models in the prevention of COVID-19 in their communities by wearing masks, installing and using handwashing facilities in public areas; (3) reached 195,899 community members in Ghana (103,971 women/girls, 91,928 men/boys). Health staff and community volunteers dispelled widespread misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine and promoted it among community members; and (4) reached 132,605 community members in Mozambique (78,995 women/girls and 53,610 men/boys) through radio broadcasts on COVID-19 prevention. The number of beneficiaries in Mozambique exceeded targets by serving an influx of internally displaced persons from insecure and cyclone-affected districts. Project-enhanced COVID-19 outreach. Results were achieved in target populations of all communities served. Increased awareness of gender equality and women’s and girl’s sexual and reproductive health and rights and of the need for more equal gender labour division in unpaid care work.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>GAIN: Keeping Food Markets Working</title>
    <description>The project aims to help sustain the availability and affordability of nutritious and safe foods, and contribute to lowering the burden of ill health, particularly for the most vulnerable. The project also supports food market continuity and protects the sustainability of key workers and supply chains in food systems across 10 countries in Africa and Asia, which face potentially catastrophic supply and demand disruption due to the coronavirus (COVID-19). The 10 countries for this project include Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, and Tanzania. COVID-19 poses the risk of worsening existing gaps in livelihoods, incomes, and assets unless support for markets and food system workers is done in a gender-sensitive way.  Project activities include: (1) supporting emergency business guidance and grants for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to provide safe and nutritious foods; (2) sustaining and reinforcing the gains of large-scale food fortification; (3) keeping food marketplace infrastructure open, but safer; (4) providing workplace nutrition protection for food system workers and their families; and (5) providing advisory and practical support to governments to help keep critical coordination mechanisms functioning, and help food systems keep working.</description>

    <title>World Vision Canada COVID-19 Response in Zimbabwe</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase equitable coverage of public health and health care services for people infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) and improve community response to and recovery from COVID-19, including specific measures for women and girls and those experiencing displacement. Project activities include: (1) procuring and distributing COVID-19 related equipment and supplies to targeted health facilities and workers; (2) training health providers in gender-sensitive COVID-19 infection, prevention and control; (3) enhancing water and handwashing systems in the Tongogara Refugee Camp; and (4) conducting a gender-informed COVID-19 public health measures awareness campaign.  This initiative expects to reach an estimated 77,608 individuals. Of this total, the project aims to reach 17,433 residents (refugees and asylum seekers) of the Tongogara Refugee Camp, inclusive of an estimated 20% of the catchment of Chipinge district health facilities and host community members.  World Vision Canada’s COVID-19 response in Zimbabwe employs a multi-pronged approach to decrease COVID-19 mortality and morbidity among marginalized populations, with a particular focus on women and girls. Targeted populations experiencing marginalization in Zimbabwe face multiple barriers that restrict their ability to prevent, seek treatment for, and recover from COVID-19.</description>

    <title>Making Motherhood Safe</title>
    <description>This project aims to mobilize a rapid response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from private sector health facilities in Dar es Salaam. The project is a public private partnership that increases coordination in providing health care services, procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) and training health care workers on COVID-19 preparedness. Dar es Salaam is at the epicenter of COVID-19 Tanzania. The pandemic has already overwhelmed public facilities, and the Government of Tanzania has requested support from the private sector in responding to the crisis. This effort is coordinated by an association of private sector health facilities (both for-profit and not-for-profit), which includes the Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT). CCBRT has on-site training facilities and expertise in providing training to nurses and doctors for 23 facilities where the majority of births take place in Dar es Salaam. This allows CCBRT to intervene to provide training and PPE, ensuring essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) care continues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People in Somalia - World Vision 2021-2022</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Despite progress towards sustainable political stability, the impact of more than three decades of insecurity, exacerbated by frequently recurring drought, increasing seasonal flooding, an ongoing historic infestation of desert locusts, and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, has left much of the population without access to basic services and ever more vulnerable to the next shock. Internal displacement remains at record levels, with an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) living in more than 2,400 sites across the country, and severe food insecurity is projected to increase in 2021, as a La Niña weather event is expected to bring renewed drought conditions early in the year. Altogether, an estimated 5.9 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, World Vision is improving access to healthcare, including treatment of acute malnutrition, safe water and sanitation, and protection services amongst crisis-affected IDPs and host communities in Somalia’s Bay region. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health workers and facilities; (2) expanding water supply systems in IDP settlements; and, (3) working with local stakeholders to improve reporting and response mechanisms for sexual and gender-based violence and other protection concerns.</description>

    <title>Ukraine Matching Fund – Canadian Red Cross Society – 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – On February 23, 2022, Russia initiated a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine. The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, damage to power and water infrastructure, and the displacement of people largely towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that more than 2.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with more than 500,000 people fleeing to neighbouring countries and more than100,000 people internally displaced.   To respond to this crisis in a timely and effective manner, Global Affairs Canada launched the Ukraine Matching Fund in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross (CRC), with the objective of addressing the life-saving needs of people in Ukraine affected by this emergency. Through this mechanism, for every eligible donation made to the Canadian Red Cross’s Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal, between February 24 and March 18, the Government of Canada will transfer an equivalent amount to the CRC, up to a total of $30 million.  The funds will be channelled by the CRC to International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners in Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and the International Committee of the Red Cross, who will deliver immediate assistance to those most in need in the country, including populations who have been displaced. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health and protection services to affected communities in Ukraine.</description>

    <title>Ukraine and neighbouring countries - Emergency Assistance - Save the Children 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – The humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorated significantly following the Russian military offensive beginning 24 February, which has resulted in over 2 million people displaced to neighbouring countries including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia, and nearly 1.5 million people internally displaced. The UN estimates that over 12 million people will need humanitarian assistance over the next three months and the UNHCR estimates that as many as 4 million people could seek refuge in neighbouring countries. On March 1, 2022, humanitarian partners issued appeals for approximately USD 2 billion to support the humanitarian response inside Ukraine over the next three months as well as the humanitarian needs of Ukrainians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. In light of the complexity of the crisis, it is anticipated that humanitarian needs will grow commensurately, which will require ongoing donor support to allow partners to scale up their humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children is providing assistance to address growing humanitarian needs in the region. This project focuses on providing immediate support services through multi-purpose cash and vouchers, non-food items, and providing protection services to at-risk children.  Project activities include: (1) providing multi-purpose cash and vouchers and non-food items assistance to conflict-affected girls, boys and their communities; (2) providing mental health and psychosocial support conflict-affected children, including unaccompanied and separated children; and (3) providing case management and protection services to boys, girls, including unaccompanied and separated children, and their communities.</description>

    <title>UNICEF Covid-19 Response in Tanzania</title>
    <description>This project seeks to support the Government of Tanzania in implementing its national coronavirus (COVID-19) response plan. The implementation includes seven integrated interventions that directly contribute to all six pillars of the plan. Project activities include: (1) mobilizing partners and resources for effective COVID-19 responses in high-risk districts; (2) enhancing district capacity to rapidly detect and investigate all suspected COVID-19 cases and manage contacts in affected areas; (3) increasing knowledge among women, men, children, adolescent girls and boys, and key vulnerable groups on COVID-19 prevention and control actions; (4) enhancing the capacity for appropriate COVID-19 case management, including nutrition care, linking case management with social welfare (including mental health and psychosocial support), and infection prevention and control; (5) strengthening community-based surveillance through community health workers and the provision of mental health and psychosocial support services for the timely detection of cases; (6) ensuring the continuity of basic services for health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, HIV, child protection, education and social assistance; and (7) providing logistical support for COVID-19 response interventions.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) public awareness raised on threat of COVID-19, increasing community support for prevention, protection of vulnerable (adolescent, women), and early treatment seeking; (2) capacity increased for appropriate COVID-19 case management, including nutrition care, infection prevention and control; (3) continuity of essential primary healthcare and education supported; (4) social welfare and child protection provided to meet the most vulnerable (including adolescents); (5) district and city capacity enhanced to rapidly detect and investigate all suspected COVID-19 cases and manage contacts in high risk districts; and (6) logistical support provided for COVID-19 preparedness and response interventions.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2022) include: (1) reached 63,211 men, 18,150 women and 14,200 children with COVID-19 prevention messaging include. Of these, provided 173 hearing or visually impaired people with braille posters and messages in sign language; (2) reached out to more than 6,000,000 people with COVID-19 information. The information facilitated the vaccination of 27,771 people; (3) supported screening of severe acute malnutrition to 227,033 children under age five. The malnutrition was due to the severe economic impacts of the pandemic on poor families and their ability to provide nutritious food to their children. The screening led to 6,710 children being referred for treatment. This has saved the lives of an estimated 3,011 children who would have died without proper nutritional support and medical treatment; and (4) distributed hygiene kits to 627,248 poor adolescent girls. The kits included laundry soap, buckets and reusable sanitary pads. These items helped lessen the effects of the pandemic on their family’s heightened poverty. It also allowed them to attend school or work while menstruating.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Multi-sector Emergency Response for Crisis-affected Communities in Yemen 2012-2023</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Yemen currently faces the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with over 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy have pushed over 16 million people to suffer from acute food insecurity, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Essential service provision has collapsed, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, this project provides multi-sectoral emergency response targeting an estimated 32,400 people in the Al-Dhale'e and Lahj governorates. Project activities include: (1) improving gender-responsive water, sanitation and hygiene services; (2) providing sexual and reproductive health and rights services; (3) providing gender-sensitive cash for work activities and unconditional cash grants; (4) conducting awareness sessions and training of sexual and reproductive health services providers; and (5) increasing access to protection and SGBV services for women, men, girls and boys.</description>

    <title>Ukraine and neighbouring countries - Emergency Assistance – SOS Children’s Villages 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – The humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorated significantly following the Russian military offensive beginning 24 February, which has resulted in over 2 million people displaced to neighbouring countries including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia, and nearly 1.5 million people internally displaced. The UN estimates that over 12 million people will need humanitarian assistance over the next three months and the UNHCR estimates that as many as 4 million people could seek refuge in neighbouring countries. On March 1, 2022, humanitarian partners issued appeals for approximately USD 2 billion to support the humanitarian response inside Ukraine over the next three months as well as the humanitarian needs of Ukrainians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. In light of the complexity of the crisis, it is anticipated that humanitarian needs will grow commensurately, which will require ongoing donor support to allow partners to scale up their humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, SOS Children’s Villages is providing assistance to address growing humanitarian needs in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. This project focuses on providing non-food items, food assistance, and health service, increasing access to water, sanitation and hygiene, and providing protection services for conflict-affected women and children.  Project activities include: (1) providing multi-purpose cash and voucher assistance for safe transport and emergency shelter; (2) providing mental health and psychosocial support (including psychosocial first aid) to crisis affected populations; (3) providing food and no-food kits to crisis affected families, especially migrants in transit and those in border areas; (4) providing gender-sensitive hygiene and dignity kits; and (5) Providing quality temporary care for unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in safe accommodations, and family reunification services.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – In response to the COVID19 global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on 25 March 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. It has three strategic priorities: 1) containing the spread of the pandemic; 2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and 3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  The GHRP is a joint and collective effort among all stakeholders, facilitated at the global level by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). As leader of the Inter-agency Steering Committee, OCHA works to oversee the global level coordination, and liaise with other stakeholders, such as the UN Crisis Management Team, as needed.  OCHA’s primary mandate is to oversee the coordination of international humanitarian responses, in partnership with national and international actors, in order to achieve more coherent and effective humanitarian action. This grant represents Canada’s support to OCHA in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Ukraine and Pakistan..  With the support of Canada and other donors, OCHA fulfills its mandate by: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting the assessment and prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Ebola Emergency support – World Food Programme – 2019</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations. With the support of GAC and other donors, WFP is providing emergency food assistance to more than 90 million people facing famine, malnutrition and severe food insecurity.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) providing supplementary feeding for children under five years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women; (3) supporting emergency school feeding programs; (4) giving vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) providing food for work.</description>

    <title>Emergency Basic Health Services Response in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide quality healthcare services to up to 22,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) providing basic healthcare services including sexual and reproductive health care; (2) increased access to a referral system and follow-up consultations; (3) providing lifesaving medication; and (4) increasing knowledge of key health practices for women, men, girls and boys.</description>

    <title>Prevention and Reduction of Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict Situations - ICRC 2020</title>
    <description>April 2020 - This project supports the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its work to prevent and reduce sexual violence in armed conflicts. Women and girls face increased vulnerability in situations of conflict and displacement, as rape and other forms of sexual violence may be used systematically as an act of reprisal and to create fear. The consequences are far reaching, affecting survivors not only physically but psychologically and socially.  For this reason, ICRC has a special initiative to strengthen its response to sexual violence, with the intention of improving delivery of services, prevention of sexual violence, and improving the capacity of its staff to respond.  The ICRC also works with States, weapons bearers, religious and traditional leaders, and communities to promote awareness of sexual violence, including awareness of International Humanitarian Law obligations prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict. The ICRC has a unique role working in conflict zones, with access to areas inaccessible by many other organizations and with greater credibility in advocating for the protection of civilians, including vulnerable women and girls.</description>

    <title>Emergency Regional Funding - ICRC Appeals 2020</title>
    <description>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect the lives and dignity of people affected by conflict and other situations of violence. The ICRC provides assistance and works to prevent further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. The ICRC works with local Red Cross and Red Crescent national society staff and volunteers to implement its protection and assistance programmes worldwide.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s 2020 humanitarian operations aim to provide protection, emergency relief and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. This funding supports the ICRC’s activities across the regions of Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia.  This funding also supports a pilot initiative launched by the ICRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) aimed at strengthening the capacity of Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies.  Project activities include: (1) protecting and assisting people affected by conflict and violence, by providing medical care, access to potable water, and restoring livelihoods; (2) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees; and (3) providing Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise and capacity support to promote international humanitarian law, restore links between lost family members, deliver health services, raise funds for emergency response and integrate gender equality into operations.</description>

    <title>Coronavirus - Emergency Appeal - UNHCR 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on March 25th, 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. The GHRP’s three strategic priorities include: (1) containing the spread of the pandemic; (2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and (3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the UNHCR provides assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern globally. Project activities include: (1) working with Ministries of Health in affected countries and the WHO, to ensure refugees and other displaced people are included in national surveillance, response planning, and activities for COVID-19; (2) establishing protection monitoring and reporting networks in collaboration with governments and partners to mitigate potential protection risks for refugees and displaced people, including restriction to access to territory and right to seek asylum; (3) increasing provision of primary and secondary health care, infection prevention in health facilities, clean water and soap, and community outreach on hygiene best practices; and (4) ensuring refugees, their host communities and persons of concern have access to timely, relevant and accurate information in applicable language(s), and counter the spread of misinformation.</description>

    <title>COVID-19 Emergency Response - Doctors Without Borders 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - The rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems, disrupted economies and altered livelihoods in many parts of the world. People living in crisis-affected settings, often in over-crowded areas, are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides medical humanitarian operations to vulnerable populations at risk of contracting and spreading the virus in countries affected by war, armed conflict and other situations of violence.  With GAC’s support, MSF aims to minimize the consequences of the pandemic on affected populations through activities that include: (1) providing direct patient care to those affected by COVID-19; (2) increasing access to primary and secondary medical care in places where gaps exist in local health systems as a result of COVID-19; and (3) increasing awareness in affected communities about the virus and prevention measures.</description>

    <title>Response to Tigray Crisis – World Food Program 2021</title>
    <description>June 2021 – Conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region has created one of the most intense humanitarian crises in the world, characterized by extreme levels of acute food insecurity, significant population displacement, and reports of widespread human rights abuses. An estimated 5.2 million people, or 90% of the regional population, require humanitarian assistance, including more than 350,000 facing famine conditions.  With GAC support, World Food Program is addressing acute food insecurity in Tigray. Project activities include: (1) providing general distribution of cash or in-kind food rations to food insecure households; (2) providing supplementary therapeutic food assistance to prevent acute malnutrition; and (3) providing transportation and logistical support to the humanitarian response in Tigray.</description>

    <title>Typhoon Rai - Emergency Response - World Food Programme 2021</title>
    <description>December 2021 – Super Typhoon Rai, locally known as Odette, made landfall in the southern Philippines on December 16, bringing torrential rains, violent winds and storm surges. Reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. It is estimated that 2.4 million people are in need as a result of the impacts of the typhoon overall, including more than 144,000 displaced people. Over 1.7 million homes have been damaged by the storm and 10.2 million hectares of agricultural land have been affected.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the typhoon. Project activities include: (1) delivering non-perishable nutritious foods to people in need; (2) providing emergency cash-for-work assistance in semi-urban and rural areas; (3) making multi-purpose cash transfers to cover immediate food needs and support livelihoods; and (4) facilitating transport and emergency logistics response equipment.</description>

    <title>Ukraine - Emergency Response - In-Kind Assistance - CRCS - 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – On February 23, 2022, Russia initiated an invasion of Ukraine. The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, power and water infrastructure damage, and people’s displacement, mainly towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that 12 million people require humanitarian assistance, with more than 3.8 million people fleeing to neighbouring countries and over 6.5 million people internally displaced.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross Society (CRCS) is providing logistical support to dispatch solicited emergency relief supplies to support humanitarian partners in the region to meet the emergency health and non-food item needs of people impacted by the crisis in Ukraine.</description>

    <title>Hunger Crisis Matching Fund - Humanitarian Coalition 2022</title>
    <description>June 2022 – In 2022, Insecurity and climate change, compounded by disruptions in food, fertilizer and fuel supply chains, are exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that is leaving millions of people facing acute hunger. This includes populations in sub-Saharan Africa currently facing famine. In response to the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs, Global Affairs Canada has launched the Hunger Crisis Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Through this mechanism, the Government of Canada is matching eligible donations made to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members for hunger crisis relief in Sub-Saharan Africa up to a maximum of $5 million.  The funds are used by Humanitarian Coalition members to deliver life-saving assistance to those most in need. Project activities include emergency cash and voucher assistance, food assistance, as well as necessary activities to support food and nutrition outcomes.</description>

    <title>Türkiye/Syria Matching Fund – Canadian Red Cross Society – 2022</title>
    <description>March 2023 – Since early February 2023, Türkiye and Syria have been impacted by multiple severe earthquakes that have resulted in over 40,000 deaths and significant damage to infrastructure. Overall, it is estimated that 9.1 million people in Türkiye and 8.8 million in Syria have been directly affected by the earthquakes. Needs assessments have revealed vulnerable earthquake-affected populations require urgent access to shelter and food assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene services, and healthcare.  To respond to this crisis in a timely and effective manner, Global Affairs Canada is matching $10 million of donations made to the Canadian Red Cross’ (CRC) Earthquake in Türkiye and Syria Appeal. The Matching Fund is addressing the life-saving needs of people affected by the earthquakes, with funds being channeled by the CRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its partners to undertake earthquake response activities. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health and protection services to earthquake-affected communities.</description>

    <title>Türkiye/Syria Earthquake Response – Emergency Assistance – UNICEF 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 – The humanitarian situation in Türkiye and Syria deteriorated significantly following powerful earthquakes that struck south-east Türkiye and north-west Syria on February 6 and February 20. The earthquakes and aftershocks resulted in widespread damages and high casualties in both countries. The UN estimates that at least 9.1 million people in Turkey and 8.8 million people in Syria have been affected by the earthquake, with the majority anticipated to need some form of humanitarian assistance in the coming months. In Türkiye, a state of emergency was declared in 10 provinces as people were left without access to shelter, food, water, heaters and medical care in harsh winter conditions. In Syria, the response is further complicated by pre-existing large scale humanitarian needs, severe access constraints for humanitarian aid, and weak infrastructure from over a decade of armed conflict.  In collaboration with the Government of Türkiye, UNICEF Türkiye co-leads the WASH sector earthquake response. With GAC’s support, UNICEF will reach 1,500,000 earthquake-affected people with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) assistance, non-food items, child protection, emergency health and nutrition operations, and psychosocial support. Project activities include: (1) deploying WASH mobile teams to highly affected areas; (2) distributing medical and water, hygiene and sanitation kits; (3) distributing non-food items; (4) providing access to protection services for earthquake-affected children; and (5) providing psychosocial services to affected individuals.</description>

    <title>Multi-Country United Nations Humanitarian Air Service - World Food Programme 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 - The World Food Program managed United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) provides essential air services to allow the humanitarian community to travel to very remote and very challenging locations. This facilitates the implementation and monitoring of a wide range of life-saving humanitarian interventions. In most countries requiring humanitarian assistance, challenging security situations, long distances and poor road conditions impede surface travel. Adequate commercial air operators do not serve most of the destinations the humanitarian community needs to reach. Aid workers rely on UNHAS to provide access in situations where reaching isolated communities is not otherwise feasible. This project operates in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen.  With GAC’s support, UNHAS facilitates access to isolated communities. Project activities include: (1) providing air transport to passengers undertaking humanitarian work; and (2) delivering light cargo for humanitarian agencies and conducting emergency medical and security evacuations.</description>

    <title>East Africa Matching Fund – Humanitarian Coalition – 2023</title>
    <description>July 2023 – There are growing humanitarian impacts of conflict and climate events in East Africa, including Sudan, that have forced hunger upon millions of people in the region. In addition, severe droughts continue to affect many of these countries, leaving millions of people without reliable access to food and water. This situation has forced nearly 1.4 million people to flee their homes since the conflict in Sudan began on April 15, 2023.  In response to the elevated humanitarian needs in the region, GAC has launched the East Africa Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Through this mechanism, the Government of Canada matches eligible donations made to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members up to a maximum of $ five million. The funds use these donations to deliver life-saving assistance to those in need. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency cash and voucher assistance to meet the basic needs of crisis-affected populations; (2) providing emergency shelter assistance and essential non-food items; (3) rehabilitating water, sanitation and hygiene facilities; and (4) providing protection and health services, including sexual and reproductive healthcare and services in response to gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Strengthening the Health Outcomes of Women and Child - COVID-19 Response</title>
    <description>This project contributes to reducing maternal and child mortality amongst vulnerable women and children, including adolescent girls, in targeted underserved remote areas of Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Nigeria and Senegal.  The project works in these five countries to improve the quality, availability and utilization of essential maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services, and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The project also works to strengthen the Canadian public’s understanding of the reasons behind Canada’s global investments in MNCH and SRH.  Project activities include: (1) raising awareness of local leaders, role models and various community groups on ongoing MNCH services and positive healthcare practices, including health care-seeking behaviours; (2) training health care providers at  community and health facility levels on key MNCH interventions; (3) providing essential medicines and other medical supplies; (4) training health administrators and local health committees on planning, supervision and oversight of health resources and facilities; (5) training health workers and drivers in referring patients requiring more advanced care at specialized facilities and providing health facilities with mobile technology and vehicles to facilitate emergency transportation; and (6) training and mentoring health care staff on improved data collection and reporting to inform local government on health resources and services planning.  COVID-19 response activities were also undertaken in 4 countries (Bangladesh, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal) that include: (1) developing and disseminating gender-integrated messaging related to COVID-19, including on hygiene, infection prevention, social distancing, mental health &amp; MNCH/SRH (including Sexual and Gender-Based Violence prevention); (2) developing and increasing awareness towards unpaid care work issues, including equitable distribution of household roles, responsibilities and resources, and women’s and girls’ decision-making; (3) providing economic support for targeted vulnerable groups negatively affected by lockdown/social distancing such as cash transfers; (4) providing training and personal protective equipment to community-based health care workers; and (5) providing public places and health facilities with safe water, hygiene supplies, health care waste management and small-scale handwashing facilities.  Plan International Canada implements this project in partnership with Promundo and the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), and with Plan International offices in the project’s 5 targeted countries, local governments, and local NGOs.</description>

    <title>World Food Programme - Hurricane Idai - 2019</title>
    <description>On March 14, Cyclone Idai, a category 2 storm, made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, and continued its journey, causing significant loss of life, damage, flooding and displacement in countries already facing acute food insecurity due to drought. The cyclone and its associated tropical depression will ultimately have claimed more than 800 lives and severely affected the livelihoods of more than 3 million people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Program (WFP) is helping to meet the immediate food needs of those affected. Project activities include: (1) distribution of food; and (2) coordination and logistical support to relief efforts.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project are: (1) increased employment of women; and (2) reduced gender-specific barriers to women's entrepreneurship and to women entering into and remaining in the workforce.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2023 include: (1) increased employment of women in the health and childcare sectors within the target communities by 25% (130 out 523 unemployed women and female youth), and is on track to reach the target of 50%; (2) 29 women graduates out of 213 joined the workforce. Of these, more than half found employment as Medical Office Assistants at hospitals and private clinics, in the Early Child Care Development (ECCD) sector and in the Health Support Workers (HSW) program; (3) seven out of ten women started home-based nurseries, which demonstrates that these women obtained new skills and gained the confidence to run a business; (4) reduced gender-specific barriers to women's entrepreneurship and to women entering into and remaining in the workforce; (5) provided education sessions, awareness-raising campaigns and community-level activities, which reached 2,223 people directly and approximately 3.9 million people indirectly; (6) implemented three piloted childcare strategies to help reduce gender-specific barriers to women’s entry in the workforce. This includes an ECCD training program, a nursery in Irbid’s Vocational Training Center (VTC), and a nursery in Istishari Hospital, which helped improve childcare services in Jordan; (7) conducted a survey at Istishari Hospital, where all respondents reported that having childcare services available in the workplace increased the option for flexible working hours., Also increased awareness on policies related to childcare and women's rights and alleviated some of the women’s financial burdens; (8) established two nurseries in partnership with the National Council for Family Affairs, one within the Irbid VTC and one in a private hospital, benefiting 56 women and seven men and enrolling a total of 78 children; and (9) 79 women benefited from the Training for employment in childcare strategy by completing the ECCD training program.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Strengthening the Health Outcomes of Women and Child - COVID-19 Response</title>
    <description>This project contributes to reducing maternal and child mortality amongst vulnerable women and children, including adolescent girls, in targeted underserved remote areas of Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Nigeria and Senegal.  The project works in these five countries to improve the quality, availability and utilization of essential maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services, and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The project also works to strengthen the Canadian public’s understanding of the reasons behind Canada’s global investments in MNCH and SRH.  Project activities include: (1) raising awareness of local leaders, role models and various community groups on ongoing MNCH services and positive healthcare practices, including health care-seeking behaviours; (2) training health care providers at  community and health facility levels on key MNCH interventions; (3) providing essential medicines and other medical supplies; (4) training health administrators and local health committees on planning, supervision and oversight of health resources and facilities; (5) training health workers and drivers in referring patients requiring more advanced care at specialized facilities and providing health facilities with mobile technology and vehicles to facilitate emergency transportation; and (6) training and mentoring health care staff on improved data collection and reporting to inform local government on health resources and services planning.  COVID-19 response activities were also undertaken in four countries (Bangladesh, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal) that include: (1) developing and disseminating gender-integrated messaging related to COVID-19, including on hygiene, infection prevention, social distancing, mental health and MNCH or SRH (including Sexual and Gender-Based Violence prevention); (2) developing and increasing awareness towards unpaid care work issues, including equitable distribution of household roles, responsibilities and resources, and women’s and girls’ decision-making; (3) providing economic support for targeted vulnerable groups negatively affected by lockdown/social distancing such as cash transfers; (4) providing training and personal protective equipment to community-based health care workers; and (5) providing public places and health facilities with safe water, hygiene supplies, health care waste management and small-scale handwashing facilities.  Plan International Canada implements this project in partnership with Promundo and the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), and with Plan International offices in the project’s 5 targeted countries, local governments, and local NGOs.</description>

    <title>United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women - 03</title>
    <description>This project represents additional emergency support of $10 million to the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women (UNTF). Canada's emergency funding is allocated to the UNTF's COVID-19 Special Funding Window. Project activities include: (1) supporting the core capacity of the UNTF's existing grantees, which are primarily women’s rights organizations, to ensure the stability of projects focused on gender-based violence and the long term sustainability of the organizations; (2) supporting the COVID-19 Response Special Funding Window, which facilitates a targeted call for proposals to fund projects designed to support women and girls survivors of gender-based violence related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) supporting a platform for identifying, analyzing and disseminating useful lessons from the results of UNTF COVID-19 response and the creation of partnerships and leveraging of resources and commitments to end violence against women and girls in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating gender-based violence, especially against women and girls. Multiple forms of violence are occurring during the pandemic and the most commonly reported is intimate partner violence. This violence is fueled by financial insecurity in households related to quarantine measures. In many cities and communities around the world, emergency services and institutional responses are overwhelmed by the COVID-19 health crisis. These and other service providers have rapidly lost the capacity to respond to the needs of women and girl survivors of violence. Civil society and women's organizations are playing a critical role at the community level and their sustained operations are vital to a comprehensive and successful pandemic response.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – In response to the COVID19 global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on 25 March 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. The three strategic priorities include: 1) containing the spread of the pandemic; 2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and 3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  The Global Humanitarian Response Plan is a joint and collective effort among all stakeholders, facilitated at the global level by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). As leader of the Inter-agency Steering Committee, OCHA works to oversee the global level coordination, and liaise with other stakeholders, such as the UN Crisis Management Team, as needed.  OCHA’s primary mandate is to oversee the coordination of international humanitarian responses, in partnership with national and international actors, in order to achieve more coherent and effective humanitarian action. This grant represents Canada’s support to OCHA in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan.  With the support of Canada and other donors, OCHA fulfills its mandate by: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting the assessment and prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Emergency Response to the Health Needs of Conflict-Affected Populations in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide inclusive health, rehabilitation, mental health, and psychosocial support services to up to 19,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) providing rehabilitation services adapted to the specific needs of women, men, girls, boys, older persons and persons with disabilities; (2) providing mental health and psychosocial services; (3) providing referrals to specialized and non-specialized services in a gender, age and disability inclusive way; and (4) supporting the establishment of a gender, age and disability inclusive feedback and complaint mechanism in all supported rehabilitation centers.</description>

    <title>Water Sanitation and Hygiene, and Protection for Conflict-Affected Persons in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection services to up to 75,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) providing safe drinking water to crisis-affected communities; (2) rehabilitating community water networks; (3) repairing sanitation facilities in a gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner; and (4) training community members and staff on gender-based violence (GBV) services and protection issues.</description>

    <title>Syria – Health – 5 – 2021-2022</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over ten years into the conflict, an estimate 13 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance. This includes more than 2.7 Internally displaced people, many of whom live in informal and overcrowded settlements, where access to essential needs and services is inadequate. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions, and humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide multisector, lifesaving and gender sensitive response to up to 154,710 beneficiaries. Project activities include: (1) providing primary and secondary healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive health support; (2) providing integrated mental health and psychosocial services; (3) providing water, sanitation and hygiene services, including distribution of hygiene kits; and (4) providing psychosocial support and specialised services to survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), including raising awareness on GBV prevention and child protection issues.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Humanitarian Pooled Fund – OCHA 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Ukraine, an estimated 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Access to essential services is severely hindered, particularly across the “contact line” in the country’s east. The shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic added pressure on a weakened healthcare system while the provision of social services struggled. Protection remains a key concern with significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages Ukraine Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of conflict-affected populations. Project activities include: (1) providing needs-based assistance in line with priorities identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan; (2) strengthening partnerships with local and international non-governmental organizations; and (3) delivering humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas, focusing mainly on non-government-controlled areas and the contact line.</description>

    <title>Support UNHCR Regional Response - Emergency Response Afghanistan - 2021</title>
    <description>Afghanistan is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as violence and insecurity have brought more suffering and internal displacement for thousands of Afghans. Over half a million internally displaced people in 2021 alone – and the number of people forced to flee continues to rise. This recent insecurity and displacement have prompted a humanitarian crisis for the Afghan people, who have already suffered more than 40 years of conflict, as well as increasing natural disasters, chronic poverty and food insecurity. Afghans already constitute one of the world’s largest refugee populations worldwide, with about three-quarters of Afghan refugees hosted in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan, with more than 2.2 million registered in the two countries. Another 3 million people were already displaced inside the country before new fighting broke out this year. The resilience of refugees, the internally displaced and host communities is being stretched to the absolute limit. Together with partners, UNHCR is committed to staying and delivering amidst the deteriorating situation and growing displacement as long as we have access to needy populations. We have activated our emergency response to protect the most vulnerable and assist newly displaced Afghans with life-saving shelter, food, water, and core relief items in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally displaced persons. With the support of GAC and other donors, the project aims to provide assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in Afghanistan and neighboring countries. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, child protection and working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and help issue identity documents; (5) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance and forge peaceful relations between refugees and local citizens; and (6) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for people of concern.</description>

    <title>Pakistan Floods Matching Fund - Humanitarian Coalition 2022</title>
    <description>October 2022 – Heavy monsoon rainfall has affected Pakistan since mid-June. The rainfall is causing widespread flooding that has affected 33 million people. Reports show that it has resulted in road closures, power outages and disruptions to communications in multiple regions. To date, over 1,300 people have died in the floods and nearly 13,000 injured. An estimated Can$20.6 million people require humanitarian aid because of the floods.  In response to the elevated level of humanitarian needs, Global Affairs Canada launched the Pakistan Floods Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Through this mechanism, the Government of Canada matches eligible donations made to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members for the floods in Pakistan up to a maximum of $7.5 million. Project activity includes delivering life-saving assistance to those most in need. This includes providing emergency cash and voucher assistance, food aid and necessary activities to support food and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Pakistan Floods - Emergency Response - WFP 2022</title>
    <description>September 2022 – Heavy monsoon rainfall has affected Pakistan since mid-June, causing widespread flooding that has affected 33 million. Reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. To date, over 1,300 people have been killed by the floods and nearly 13,000 injured. Rapid assessments conducted by government authorities and humanitarian agencies have identified initial priority humanitarian needs as food assistance, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and healthcare. An estimated6.4 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the floods.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by flooding. Project activities include: (1) delivering in-kind food assistance to people in need; (2) making multi-purpose cash transfers to cover immediate food needs and support livelihoods; and (3) providing logistical support to the emergency response.</description>

    <title>UNICEF Emergency Afghanistan Support 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs continue to worsen, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2023, an estimated 28 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19), widespread economic decline, and climatic events.  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is mandated by the United Nations General-Assembly to advocate for the protection of children's rights, help meet their basic needs, and expand opportunities to reach their full potential. UNICEF works in developing countries through its development and humanitarian assistance programming to fulfill its mandate, including promoting the equal rights of girls and women and support their full participation in the political, social, and economic development of their communities.  With Global Affairs Canada’s support, in humanitarian emergencies, UNICEF is providing life-saving health and nutrition interventions for children, pregnant and lactating women to support the treatment, growth and development of healthy children. The main activity for this project is to procure ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severe acute malnutrition and child wasting.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Hygiene, Health and Livelihoods Assistance - CARE Canada 2020 to 2021</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Basic service provision is collapsing, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s multi-year support, CARE Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene, and reproductive health services, and livelihoods support to up to 43,877 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Taiz and Ibb governorates of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing cash assistance to enable beneficiaries to meet their basic needs; (2) rehabilitating or establishing water sources and latrines in rural communities; (3) providing hygiene and dignity kits; and (4) providing training to community health workers, and providing medical supplies to promote sexual and reproductive health services.</description>

    <title>Emergency Assistance - Regional-Level Funding for Africa, Americas and Asia - UNHCR 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - The Africa region continues to accommodate the largest population of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worldwide, with over 27 million people of concern. The Asia and Pacific region is home to nearly 9 million people of concern to the UNHCR, and the Americas includes close to 18 million people of concern. The UNHCR provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally displaced persons.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the UNHCR is helping provide assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in Africa, the Americas and Asia in ODA-eligible countries. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation, and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, and for children; (5) working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and helping issue identity documents; (6) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance, and forge peaceful relations between refugees and host communities; and (7) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for persons of concern.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Local Agricultural Supply Chains - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to protect the food security and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations impacted by COVID-19 in nine countries. The project works with local governments and civil society groups to ensure communities most impacted by COVID-19 have sustained access to nutritious food and sources of income. It also addresses trade barriers in the food and agricultural sector and improves food safety standards during COVID-19 and beyond, and strengthens local capacity for data collection and analysis in order to make informed policy decisions that improve local food systems.  Key activities include: 1) Rapid assessment of community and household-level needs, as well as local market capacities and gaps related to COVID-19. 2) Supporting farmers with facilitated access to seeds and other farm inputs, markets, training in climate-smart agricultural practices, and income diversification activities. 3) Capacity building training for rural and agricultural community based organizations in coordination with local government services and departments, with a focus on addressing barriers related to COVID-19. 4) Support for public social protection programs in reaching rural and marginalized communities.</description>
