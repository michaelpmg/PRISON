    <title>Global Partnership for Education - Institutional Support 2018-2021</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s institutional support to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). The GPE uses these funds, along with other donors’ funding, to achieve its mandate.  The GPE is the main multilateral funding mechanism focused on basic education in developing countries. It aims to mobilize global and national efforts to contribute to the achievement of equitable, quality education and learning for all, through inclusive partnership, with a focus on effective and efficient education systems and increased financing. The GPE’s strategic goals include: improved and more equitable learning outcomes; increased equity, gender equality and inclusion; and effective and efficient education systems. It provides a platform for coordination among bilateral donors, developing countries, multilateral institutions and civil society organizations. The GPE also fosters mutual accountability, shares knowledge about best practices and encourages transparency at all levels.  Some program activities include: (1) providing country-level funding to increase  children’s access to education; (2) supporting education sector plans that focus on increasing the quality of teaching and the number of qualified teachers; (3) providing appropriate reading materials to children; and (4) assessing the volume of financing to education at the global and country levels.</description>

    <title>Seventh Replenishment (2018-2022) - Global Environment Facility (GEF)</title>
    <description>This project represents Canada's support to the seventh replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is one of the largest sources of global environment funding. By supporting the GEF, Canada helps developing countries meet their obligations under several multilateral environmental agreements in a way that supports national sustainable development priorities and ensures benefits for local development. These multilateral environmental agreements include the Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and Minamata Convention on Mercury.  Through the GEF, Canada supports activities across six focal areas, including climate change, biodiversity, land degradation, chemicals and waste, international waters, and sustainable forest management.</description>

    <title>Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria - Institutional Support 2020 to 2022</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to the Global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria uses these funds, along with other donors’ funding, to achieve its mandate.  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a unique, public-private partnership and international financing institution dedicated to attracting and disbursing additional resources to prevent and treat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities, which represents an innovative approach to international health financing. The Global Fund’s model is based on the concepts of country ownership and performance-based funding. This means that organizations in developing countries implement their own programs based on their own priorities and must be able to show the results achieved.  Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund has become the main global financier of programs to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, with approved funding in more than 100 countries. This grant contributes towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goal target of eliminating HIV, tuberculosis and malaria as epidemics by 2030 by supporting countries to scale up treatment and prevention services. This grant also contributes to improving the health and rights of women and children (including adolescents) and focuses international assistance efforts on helping the poorest and most vulnerable.</description>

    <title>Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator Health Systems Connector</title>
    <description>This project aims to decrease COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity in 74 countries, particularly for populations experiencing marginalization or in situations of vulnerability. The project supports the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator’s Health Systems Connector to urgently reinforce national and regional health system responses to the COVID-19 pandemic using a coordinated multi-partner approach. This would allow them to implement frontline service capacity assessments, identify cross-cutting gaps in essential health systems and services, develop readiness plans, and provide technical support and relevant guidance and instruments.</description>
