    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance - Solidarités International 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 – Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) rapidly deteriorated. In 2017, the country continued to be plagued by violent conflict between armed groups and inter-communal violence.  The number of displaced people in the country has increased to over 1.24 million, comprised of roughly 688,000 internally displaced people and 556,375 refugees – the highest number ever recorded in CAR. In 2018, an estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance.  With GAC’s support, Solidarités International is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 10,100 conflict-affected people in Ouham and Nana-Gribizi prefectures, in the CAR. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as livelihoods support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 14 water points, benefitting up to 7,000 people; (2) raising awareness on hygiene practices of up to 7,000 people; (3) providing up to 120 vulnerable women with livelihood kits, benefitting up to 600 people; and (4) distributing food vouchers to 400 vulnerable households, benefitting up to 2,000 people.</description>

    <title>Jane Goodall Institute of Canada - IAYI Internships 2018-2022</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Aboriginal Youth Internships (IAYI) initiative. The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  As part of the Promoting Indigenous Youth Engagement project, the Jane Goodall Institute of Canada (JGI-Canada), in partnership with the First Nations’ Forestry Society, sends 34 Indigenous youth to Uganda. Through their work on a range of diverse projects, they focus on issues of environmental sustainability, gender equality and improving Indigenous livelihoods. For example, through JGI’s “Roots and Shoots” program, interns help to promote the inter-connectedness of people, nature and animals, and empower young people to take action. The project is carried out in collaboration with local partners and communities in Bushenyi, Hoima and Masidi Districts in Uganda.</description>

    <title>Comité de solidarité de Trois-Rivières - IAYI Internships 2018-2022</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Aboriginal Youth Internships (IAYI) initiative. The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  The Comité de solidarité de Trois-Rivières sends 40 Indigenous youth to two countries as part of the Indigenous youth without borders project. The purpose of the project is for the Indigenous interns to provide support to people from the communities of San Ramos, Nicaragua, and Kébémer, Senegal, to strengthen the local economy. The interns contribute to the development of capacities related to sustainable tourism, handicrafts, sustainable agricultural development, and civic and economic rights promotion.</description>

    <title>Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland - IAYI Internships 2018-2022</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Aboriginal Youth Internships (IAYI) initiative. The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  As part of the Improving Indigenous Youth Opportunities project, the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland, in a consortium with the Labrador Aboriginal Training Partnership and the Nunatsiavut Group of Companies, sends 21 Indigenous youth to Belize. They focus on environmental sustainability, gender equality and improving Indigenous livelihoods through their work on diverse projects with local partners. Activities focus on addressing youth empowerment through cultural reclamation, and working with Belize’s Indigenous peoples and its National Institute of Culture and History on conservation issues.</description>

The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  L’AMIE, in consortium with the First Nations Human Resources Development Commission of Quebec, sends 50 Indigenous youth to Bolivia as part of the Enhancing Indigenous Cultures project. The interns help enhance Bolivian Indigenous culture through three components focused on children and youth: their education (formal and informal); their health (physical and psychological); and their safety (child and Indigenous rights).</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Common Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 – Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) rapidly deteriorated. In 2017, the country continued to be plagued by violent conflict between armed groups and inter-communal violence. The number of displaced people in the country has increased to over 1.24 million, comprised of roughly 688,000 internally displaced people and 556,375 refugees – the highest number ever recorded in CAR. In 2018, an estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance.  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as United Nations agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. The CHF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national NGOs, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Libya - Emergency Assistance - ACTED 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 – Since 2014, civilians have been suffering as a result of conflict, political instability and a collapsing economy in Libya. Conflict-affected people are often living in unsafe conditions and high-risk, hostile environments, with little or no access to life-saving health care, essential medicines, food, safe drinking water, shelter and education. There are over 1.1 million people in Libya in need of humanitarian assistance, including 170,000 internally displaced people, 200,000 returnees and 376,000 vulnerable Libyans. In addition, there are an estimated 64,000 refugees and 337,000 migrants in Libya facing significant protection concerns, with their status making them particularly vulnerable to abuse, marginalization and exploitation. Given the current environment, Libya has become a regional nexus point for human smuggling operations and irregular migration to Europe – in 2017, over 2,800 people lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.  With GAC’s support, the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) is providing emergency cash assistance for up to 4,000 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly female headed households, in the Tripoli and surrounding areas of Libya.</description>

    <title>Pakistan - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Pakistan continues to face multiple humanitarian crises, including conflict-induced displacement; a large contingent of Afghan refugees; high levels of malnutrition; and vulnerability to natural disasters. Since 2009, the country has experienced significant displacement of people as a result of the military-led security operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. More than 40,000 families still remain displaced in host communities and require humanitarian support. For those who are able to return, conditions are difficult due to significant damage to community infrastructure, water supply systems and educational and health centres. The country is currently hosting more than 1.3 million Afghan refugees and more than 600,000 undocumented Afghans.  With GAC’s support, the Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations as well as United Nations agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in Pakistan. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) strengthening coordination and leadership within the humanitarian response; (3) improving the relevance and coherence of the humanitarian response; and (4) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas. In 2018, key priority sectors include shelter, health, and water, sanitation and hygiene.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Red Cross 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 647,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already in the district of Cox's Bazar following earlier waves of displacement.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross is helping to respond to the immediate water, sanitation, health and protection needs of vulnerable people in Cox’s Bazar. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care services through mobile and static clinics or health posts; (2) distributing hygiene and dignity kits that take into account women’s and girls’ needs; (3) promoting good hygiene practices through public awareness and education campaigns; and (4) providing safe spaces and referring particularly vulnerable groups for additional services and support, including unaccompanied minors.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - ADRA Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 671,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Many have arrived exhausted and traumatised and are now living in difficult conditions in camps and settlements. These new arrivals have joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already in the district of Cox’s Bazar following earlier waves of displacement.  With GAC’s support, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA Canada) is helping to respond to the immediate needs of refugees in Cox’s Bazar, with a particular focus on women with children under 5 years of age, girls, boys, the elderly and persons with special needs. Activities include: (1) providing gender-responsive shelter kits and tools; (2) providing dignity kits and essential household items such as blankets and mosquito nets; (3) promoting hygiene and health; and (4) providing child friendly spaces and safe spaces for women and girls.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance – Solidarités International 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 - Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) deteriorated rapidly, as inter-communal violence spun out of control and led to thousands of deaths, massive human displacement, and grave human rights abuses. Elections in March 2016 saw the introduction of a new President in CAR that brought a welcome yet short lived calm to the country. However, CAR continues to be plagued by violence, armed criminality, and widespread humanitarian needs. Conflict between armed groups has persisted across much of CAR in 2017: armed groups have fragmented and reformed among various alliances, complicating the ongoing crisis. An estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance in 2018. There has been a 50% spike in internal displacement, with internally displaced people now totalling over 688,000. The number of refugees has also increased to 556,375 bringing the total number of people displaced to over 1.24 million people—the highest number ever recorded in CAR. Attacks on and looting of humanitarian actors increased in 2017 and are hindering their ability to respond to needs relating to widespread food insecurity, high levels of child malnutrition, and protection of the most vulnerable populations, including women and girls.  With GAC’s support, Solidarites International is providing emergency assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 14,500 conflict-affected people in Ouham-Pendé and Ouham prefectures, CAR. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, non-food items, as well as livelihoods support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 12 latrine blocks, benefitting up to 3,000 people; (2) constructing or rehabilitating up to 6 shower blocks, benefitting up to 3,000 people; (3) raising the awareness of  up to 7,000 people of hygiene best practices; (4) providing up to 1,500 vulnerable women with hygiene kits; and (5) distributing food vouchers, benefitting up to 3,000 people.</description>

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2018</title>
    <description>April 2018: The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is characterized by a complex combination of vulnerability to natural disasters, armed conflict, inter-communal tension, statelessness and displacement. It is estimated that 863,000 crisis-affected women, men, boys and girls will be in need of humanitarian assistance this year.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian situation. Project activities include: (1) filling critical gaps to support life-saving activities, such as shelter, health or protection; (2) promoting needs-based assistance, including targeting the most vulnerable in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased consensus among diverse groups of influential Syrians on detailed measures to establish and manage a credible political process; (2) enhanced trust between representatives of key Syrian constituencies across political, social, ethnic and sectarian divides, in a way that contributes to sustainable peacebuilding; (3) strengthened development of mature and pragmatic political positions in preparation for engagement in a credible political process and the subsequent transitional arrangements; and (4) supported UN and international actors involved in the Track I process through channeling innovative and broadly sourced Syrian ideas on how to demonstrate possible avenues of compromise as part of a viable political settlement.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2019) include: (1) five TSG’s Intra-Syrian Dialogues were organized, which brought together a broad and representative spectrum of influential Syrian figures at the national level, aiming to develop consensus on key issues and generate proposals that could positively influence the Track I/constitutional process. Subjects included; efforts to advance a constitutional process and wider stabilization initiatives driven by international players; (2) five Joint Track Meetings were conducted in which representatives of independent and loyalist constituencies from inside Syria to engaged with oppositionists and other Syrians based outside the country, in a discreet and informal setting. These meetings have forum developed innovative proposals on advancing the political process, and broadening consensus on those proposals; and (3) three Arab-Kurdish dialogue brought together Arabs and Kurdish members of the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) to address reforms of their governance structures as a necessary step to ensure longer term stability in the region. Chief among Arab grievances are a lack of representation and a deficit in democratic practice. They called on the SDC to open up the space for civil society organizations (CSOs) and political parties/movements to practice freely and effectively, without fear of arrest or reprisal. Participants on both sides agreed a list of criteria which could help inform the SDC and CSOs on best practice.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Pathways to Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction for Women and Girls</title>
    <description>The research project aims to strengthen evidence to inform policies and practices to reduce poverty and vulnerability of women and girls in poor communities. The research focuses on women’s economic empowerment, and sexual and reproductive health. It seeks to identify harmful or discriminatory social norms and examine how they constrain women and girls’ potential by increasing social exclusion, poverty and vulnerability. The research findings, which are shared with  local communities, governments, research organizations and civil society organizations, identify effective measures in policies and programs that would mitigate or remove discriminatory social norms and strengthen women and girls’ empowerment and gender equality. The research findings contribute to the Advancing Learning and Innovation on Gender Norms program, and the Gender Adolescence: Global Evidence program. This project is designed to contribute to research and knowledge sharing.</description>

    <title>Global Nutrition Report 2018</title>
    <description>This project supports Development Initiatives in developing and publishing the 2018 Global Nutrition Report.   The Global Nutrition Report is the leading independent accountability mechanism for nutrition. Established in 2013 as an outcome of the Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Global Compact, the Report seeks to increase accountability for greater action to end malnutrition with a focus on curating high quality, comprehensive and credible data on nutrition outcomes and its determinants; and accounting for stakeholder commitments, policies and interventions designed to improve nutrition and financing for nutrition. Data produced by the Report exposes barriers faced by nutrition stakeholders, and highlights potential for action and advocacy for improved nutrition. The Report also holds donors, governments and private sector stakeholders accountable to their policy and financial commitments pledged through Nutrition for Growth and tracks donor and country annual spending towards nutrition.  The 2018 Report focuses on success stories in nutrition to encourage nutrition stakeholders to take action. Specifically, the Report  aims to: (1) feature country actions addressing malnutrition burdens; (2) validate new data indicators and measures; (3) showcase private sector workforce commitments made through Nutrition for Growth, and (4) feature thematic chapters on diet, food environments and food systems, and country level implementation of interventions and policies to address the double burden of malnutrition.</description>

    <title>Blended Finance Approaches and Tools to Support Women and Girls</title>
    <description>The project seeks to strengthen evidence about how approaches, tools and mechanisms can be used to mobilize additional private and public sector financing -- referred to as blended finance -- for development that supports women and girls’ empowerment. Project activities include: (1) examining policies and approaches used by low- and lower-middle-income countries, international financial institutions and donors, with a focus on increasing the economic opportunities for the poor, particularly women; (2) highlighting blended finance approaches and design mechanisms which create, or are likely to create, increased financing that supports women’s economic empowerment, including their access to finance and business development services, as well as entrepreneurship training and business ownership; and (3) identifying opportunities to include women as leaders, experts and policy makers on development finance issues in order to bring new voices from low- and lower-middle-income countries into the dialogue and decision-making process.</description>

    <title>Building Inclusive Communities through Virtual Exchange</title>
    <description>The objective of this project is to empower youth to become aware of different cultural realities and engage as active citizens in their local and global communities. The project is designed to foster constructive dialogue in communities, with a view to help societies resolve differences from a confrontational approach to one defined by cooperation and understanding.  The project focuses on young men and women with a post-secondary degree in Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, Turkey and Tunisia. Key activities include: (1) a virtual dialogue program for some 3,500 youth participants which facilitates dialogue with the goal of cultivating knowledge and confidence to become civically active; (2) online trainings designed to develop dialogue skills to mobilize communities; and (3) community dialogue sessions with the goal of tackling contentious community issues such as youth participation in peace-building, decision-making, gender equality, and prevention of radical beliefs.</description>

    <title>Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami - Emergency Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Shelter – CARE – 2018</title>
    <description>October 2018 – On September 28, 2018, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia. Following the earthquake, a tsunami hit the regions of Palu, Donggala and Sigi. The disasters caused widespread flooding and devastation in central Sulawesi, damaging basic services such as water and health services, and destroying homes and urban infrastructure. An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected and close to 200,000 are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is addressing urgent humanitarian needs of up to 15,500 vulnerable people (3,100 households) affected by the earthquakes and tsunami in the Donggala region, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Project activities include: (1) providing hygiene awareness sessions and distributing gender- sensitive hygiene kits; (2) repairing or constructing communal latrine facilities; (3) providing emergency shelter and non-food items to disaster-affected households; and (4) providing cash-for-work activities and unconditional funding grants.</description>

    <title>Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami - Emergency Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Protection – Plan 2018</title>
    <description>October 2018 – On September 28, 2018, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia. Following the earthquake, a tsunami hit the regions of Palu, Donggala and Sigi. The disasters caused widespread flooding and devastation in central Sulawesi, damaging basic services such as water and health services, and destroying homes and urban infrastructure. An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected and close to 200,000 are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance.  With GAC’s support, Plan International Canada is providing support for water, sanitation, hygiene, and protection interventions for an estimated 4,000 individuals (1,000 households) affected by the earthquakes and tsunami in the Sigi and Donggala districts, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Activities include: (1) increasing access to safe drinking water and hygiene needs; (2) constructing gender-segregated latrines and bathing spaces; (3) enhancing protection services and psycho-social support for vulnerable children; and (4) raising awareness on menstrual hygiene and gender-based violence, and providing dignity kits to support vulnerable adolescent girls and women.  The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased equitable access to safe gender-responsive water and sanitation services and facilities for disaster-impacted populations; (2) improved knowledge and capacity in hygiene among disaster-impacted populations; and (3) protection services strengthened to prevent and respond to child protection concerns in a safe, accessible and gender-responsive manner.</description>

    <title>Enabling Women's Potential in Peace Processes in the Sahel</title>
    <description>The purpose of the initiative is to prepare women from conflict-affected Francophone countries to participate fully in current and/or future peace processes. This is done by offering them a cycle of technical training as well as tools so they can fully participate in the various steps of the peace process. The project seeks to address the shortage of training in French in this area. It is aimed at women leaders who have distinguished themselves through their involvement in the community, politics, the economy and/or society, and who come from the Sahel region (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mauritania and Chad) as well as Côte d’Ivoire. The training takes place in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and/or at the École de Maintien de la Paix in Bamako, Mali. The project includes the following activities: (1) enhancing participants’ knowledge of various topics relating to the peace process; (2) building relationships among the various participants; (3) introducing participants to potential peace process partners, donors and stakeholders to encourage their involvement.</description>

    <title>Scenario-Based Leadership Training for the United Nations</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the effectiveness of training on peacekeeping for United Nations (UN) heads of mission so that they are better equipped to manage contemporary crises, lead teams and effectively deliver the mandate of the United Nations. By modernizing and enhancing existing training scenarios to incorporate new, more relevant issues and situations faced by UN peacekeeping missions, the project is directly assisting heads of mission in responding to needs on the field.  Project activities include: (1) designing, developing and piloting eight real-life peacekeeping scenarios; (2) publishing four papers on leadership development and training; and (3) validating all scenarios by an expert advisory group.</description>

    <title>Support of Women's Capacity to Mediate Electoral Conflicts in DRC</title>
    <description>The project is designed to contribute to peace consolidation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by getting women significantly involved in a peaceful electoral process. The project is helping to improve women’s participation in managing electoral conflicts and in promoting civic education in 10 provinces. Project activities include: (1) building the capacity of 45 women leaders in electoral conflict mediation and management; (2) organizing three capacity-building workshops for 45 women candidates or potential candidates on developing communication strategies in an election period, the various legal instruments protecting women, and advocacy; (3) organizing 16 advocacy missions about appointing women and girls to decision-making positions; (4) subsidizing 16 women’s organizations so they can implement projects pertaining to outreach, women’s participation in the electoral process, preventing and managing electoral conflicts, electoral observation and monitoring the status of women; and (5) organizing three capacity-building sessions on civic education and electoral observation for 30 women and girl leaders.</description>

    <title>Supporting the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Burundi</title>
    <description>This project supports the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi (OHCHR) to ensure that it maintains its operations in the country from June 2018-March 2019. The on-going political, security, economic and human rights crisis requires a strong OHCHR presence in Burundi. OHCHR-Burundi systematically monitors the institutions and places of detention, essentially all those where violations are known to occur, to document them and recommend preventive measures and remedies to dissuade further abuses from occurring. OHCHR-Burundi’s monitoring activities also serve as a basis for reporting to relevant actors in Geneva and New York in order to inform the ongoing political dialogue on the situation of the country and to inform the diplomatic community through regular briefings organised in the country.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthen rule of law and accountability for human rights violations; (2) enhance and protect civic spaces and people’s participation; (3) Integrate human rights in sustainable development, and (4) ensure early warning, prevention and protection of human rights in situations of conflict and insecurity.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2018) include: (1) engaged 60 lawyers and 20 human rights defenders in training sessions on the effective implementation of the state’s law on the Protection of Victims, Witnesses and other Persons at Risk; (2) facilitated the participation of 130 people (of which 69 women) in Women’s Day activities on the impact of the state’s laws on gender-based violence; and (3) produced 231 daily reports and 11 monthly reports on the human rights situation in Burundi.  This project ended abruptly as the partner, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), was forced to leave Burundi and has not returned. For this reason, some project activities were not accomplished; however, the project did achieve the results described above.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to the Municipal and Regional Electoral Process in Tunisia</title>
    <description>The goal of this project is to improve the integrity of and support the municipal and regional electoral process in Tunisia scheduled for May 2018. The project provides tailored approaches to rural areas with higher illiteracy rates to ensure women have equal opportunities to participate in the electoral process.  Project activities include: (1) providing training to targeted civil society organizations to strengthen their organizational capacity to observe municipal elections throughout the country, and ensure gender equity among observers; (2) providing training to 300 new women ambassadors so they are equipped with outreach tools to interact face-to-face with registered women and persuade them to vote; and (3) civic educators conduct targeted civic and voter education campaigns for rural illiterate women, youth and marginalized groups, through radio programming, videos or coffee talks.  Through GAC’s support, this project contributes to a USAID project by expanding current outreach activities for illiterate rural women in both geographic coverage and scope reaching up to 7.6 million radio listeners and viewers.</description>

    <title>Indonesia Earthquake - Emergency Response to Vulnerable Populations in Sulawesi - IFRC 2018</title>
    <description>October 2018 – On September 28, 2018, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia. Following the earthquake, a tsunami hit the regions of Palu, Donggala and Sigi. The disasters caused widespread flooding and devastation in central Sulawesi, damaging basic services such as water and health services, and destroying homes and urban infrastructure. An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected and close to 200,000 are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance.  With GAC’s support, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is helping provide shelter, health services, livelihood support and other essential services to disaster-affected people in Indonesia. Project activities include: (1) provision of safe drinking water and distribution of hygiene items and dignity kits; (2) provision of cash assistance and in-kind support to help meet basic needs and/or re-establish income-generating activities; (3) provision of emergency shelter and materials to repair damaged houses; (4) establishing and operating women and children safe spaces; and (5) provision of emergency first aid and basic health care, including psychosocial support to affected communities.</description>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Assistance in the North-West and South-West Regions - NRC 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Cameroon is experiencing three distinct humanitarian crises in 2019: (i) violence in northeastern Nigeria, cross-border raids and suicide attacks have caused massive displacements in the Far North region; (ii) conflict and insecurity in the Central African Republic continue to cause an influx of refugees east of the country; (iii) social tensions in the North-West and South-West – the “Anglophone regions” – have led to armed conflict between non-governmental armed groups and national security forces, leading to massive internal displacement. The country is vulnerable to food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to adequate basic social services.  With GAC’s support, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is helping to assist up to 15,000 conflict-affected people in the North-West and South-West. Project activities include: (1) providing adequate shelter and essential basic items to 2,500 vulnerable households; (2) distributing dignity kits for women and girls, which contain items required to maintain feminine hygiene, dignity and respect in their daily lives, benefiting up to 3,000 women and girls; (3) constructing or rehabilitating household emergency latrines, benefiting up to 2,000 people; and (4) building the capacity of local NGOs to address gender and protection, and their understanding of humanitarian and “Do No Harm” principles.</description>

    <title>Ukraine - Emergency Assistance and Protection - 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 3.5 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Limited livelihood opportunities and the increased cost of essential goods and services due to the conflict, including food, health care and heating, are reducing vulnerable people’s ability to cope, especially in the winter. Some 1.5 million people remain displaced. Protection remains a key concern, largely due to daily shelling as well as the heavy presence of landmines and explosive remnants of war in populated areas of the Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, along the 457-km “contact line”. An average of 1.1 million people cross the contact line each month to access essential services and maintain family links, facing high security risks and harsh weather conditions.  With GAC’s support, the project is helping to improve the lives of conflict-affected people in Eastern Ukraine.</description>

    <title>Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Support for Evidence-Based Decision-Making and Assessment Capacities</title>
    <description>This project also know as the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) aims to improve coordinated multi-sector needs assessments before, during, or after the humanitarian response to the Rohingya refugee and other global humanitarian crises.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the project provides evidence-based analysis for decision-making during humanitarian crises. Project activities include: (1) developing innovative needs assessment methodologies and tools in order to provide faster, more precise and cost effective assessments of humanitarian crises; and (2) training organizations and experts to build a roster of trained deployable assessment experts.  This project is being implemented by a consortium of two international non-governmental organizations: Save the Children and the Norwegian Refugee Council.</description>

    <title>Tanzania - Emergency Assistance to Burundian and Congolese Refugees - Oxfam Canada 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - Tanzania was host to over 327,000 refugees and asylum-seekers by November 30, 2018, mainly from Burundi (74.1%) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (25.7%). The majority of refugees and asylum-seekers are hosted by the Government of Tanzania in three refugee camps in northwestern Tanzania – Nyarugusu, Nduta, and Mtendeli. Since 2017, restrictions on access to territory and asylum have increased. All 19 border entry and reception points for Congolese as well as Burundian asylum seekers were closed between March 2017 and July 2018. In addition, despite widely-shared safety concerns about the situation in Burundi, the voluntary repatriation operation began in September 2017. As of November 30, 2018, 56,049 people had returned to Burundi as part of the operation.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam Canada works to address the needs of up to 96,598 Congolese and Burundian conflict-affected refugees and asylum-seekers in Nduta Camp and surrounding host communities. The project focuses on providing access to safe and sustainable water sources for domestic use, gender-appropriate and safe sanitation facilities, and gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate hygiene materials and information. Project activities include: (1) improving water supply systems reaching up to 19,042 households; (2) rehabilitating and constructing sanitation facilities for up to 14,477 households; (3) establishing solid waste recycling systems for up to 18,742 households; and (4) providing gender-sensitive hygiene awareness sessions for up to 72,362 people.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Emergency Assistance - HelpAge International - 2019</title>
    <description>In 2019, drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Internationally displaced populations are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, HelpAge International is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up 12,000 elderly and other highly vulnerable people amongst South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia’s remote Gambella region. This project focuses on providing nutrition, health and protection assistance sensitive to age, disability and gender considerations to vulnerable people unable to access these services in refugee camps. Project activities include: (1) training 2,400 refugees of all ages on health and nutrition; (2) providing food and nutrient supplements to 1,600 acutely malnourished people; (3) providing basic health services, including home-based care, to 800 persons with specific needs; and (4) strengthening the capacity of staff and humanitarian actors in gender, age and disability inclusion programming.</description>

    <title>Mozambique - Humanitarian Response to Cyclone Idai - Doctors Without Borders 2019</title>
    <description>April 2019 – On March 15, 2019, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique before continuing inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, causing substantial loss of life and injury. The cyclone resulted in severe damage to infrastructure, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, and thousands of hectares of standing crops. An estimated three million people across the region are in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the cyclone.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders is providing emergency medical assistance to cyclone-affected populations in Mozambique. Emergency health services are helping to meet the immediate needs of an estimated 800,000 people by, providing basic health care through mobile clinics, access to safe drinking water, and through the treatment of cholera cases and other waterborne diseases.</description>

    <title>Cyclone Kenneth - Emergency Assistance for Mozambique - IOM 2019</title>
    <description>May 2019 - On April 24, 2019, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique causing substantial damage to homes, infrastructure and crops. Tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and up to an estimated 380,000 are in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the cyclone.  With GAC support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by Cyclone Kenneth in multiple sectors in Mozambique. This assistance includes protection, shelter, emergency non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health, and camp coordination and management. With the support of Canada and other donors, IOM is also facilitating access to essential relief items and adequate living conditions for crisis-affected populations.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter and non-food items to households displaced by the Cyclone impact; (2) coordinating camp management for internally displaced people; (3) provision of adequate sanitation facilities and safe water through trucking and/or rehabilitation of damaged water points; (4) data collection, including mapping of populations that face increased vulnerabilities for enhanced targeting and delivery of assistance; (5) providing transportation and other support to improve access to healthcare facilities to increase access to medical care for the most vulnerable; and (6) protection and gender mainstreaming across activities with provision for extremely vulnerable individuals including women and children.</description>

    <title>Building a Culture of Peaceful Pluralism in Myanmar and Sri Lanka</title>
    <description>This project seeks to address the social and political factors that contribute to ethnic and religious intolerance and cycles of violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The project works to influence public opinion on issues of religious freedom and ethnic diversity in support of peaceful pluralism, by supporting civil society organizations and journalists. Project activities include: (1) increasing the production of high-quality, inclusive media content; (2) enhancing the flow of trusted, non-inflammatory information within and between communities, with an emphasis on social media and online content; (3) increasing awareness and understanding of ethnic and religious rights; and (4) promoting a culture of accountability that gives a voice to communities directly affected by discrimination and violence.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Development and Peace 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace is helping to provide safe shelters and secure settlements to Rohingya refugees in the camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Project activities include: (1) distributing material for transitional shelters and upgrades to existing shelters according to priorities identified by refugee households; (2) providing house-to-house technical assistance following the distribution of shelter materials; (3) providing gender sensitive semi-permanent shelters for particularly vulnerable households, such as women or child-headed households; and (4) providing solar lighting and other site improvements.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - World Vision 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months.These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, World Vision Canada is helping to meet the needs of Rohingya refugees with comprehensive programming to protect them from gender-based violence (GBV). Project activities include: (1) conducting awareness-raising sessions at various community protection spaces on sexual and reproductive health, child rights, good hygiene practices, and socialization for adolescent girls and boys; (2) mobilizing communities to conduct awareness-raising sessions on GBV and child protection violations, including child marriage; (3) providing case by case support to children and women at risk as identified; (4) providing psychosocial support to vulnerable girls and boys at community protection spaces; and (5) providing gender and age-appropriate livelihood opportunities, via cash-for-work activities.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased knowledge and skills within the refugee community of community-based mechanisms of protection against GBV and child violations., such as abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence, using age-specific and culturally-appropriate approaches for women, girls and boys; and (2) increased access to holistic, age-specific and culturally-appropriate responsive services for women, girls and boys that have survived GBV and child protection violations. The expected ultimate outcome is reduced vulnerability, increased and maintained human dignity (particularly for women and girls), and vulnerable lives saved of displaced populations affected by the Rohingya humanitarian crisis in Cox’s Bazar.</expectedResults>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis – Plan Canada 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Plan International Canada is helping to respond to the immediate needs of adolescents affected by the Rohingya refugee crisis, with a specific emphasis on adolescent girls. Project activities include: (1) establishing separate adolescent boys and girls youth clubs with information and services; (2) providing gender-responsive case management services for adolescent girls and boys in need of protection; and (3) training key community stakeholders on coordination of services and gender-responsive community-level protection of children.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency and Medical Humanitarian Response - Doctors Without Borders 2019-2020</title>
    <description>February 2019 – From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as Ituri province, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2018 has pushed the limits of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services, has exacerbated live-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt of this context, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict, and where widespread human rights abuses and sexual violence are prevalent. In 2018, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders aims to help address the humanitarian and medical needs of up to 300,000 people per year in 16 provinces of the DRC. The project focuses on providing urgent lifesaving emergency preventative, primary and secondary healthcare, and, through improved surveillance, early detection of possible disease outbreaks, and quick assessment and response to disease outbreaks and medical and humanitarian emergencies.  Project activities include: (1) provide outpatient consultations to population in area of response; (2) provide testing, diagnoses and treatment of main morbidities; (3) distribute non-food item (NFI) kits including bed nets and sanitation supplies; and (4) provide individual and group counselling/mental health sessions to vulnerable groups of women, children and adolescents, including survivors of sexual and/or gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Emergency Health Care - Doctors without Borders Canada 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.3 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.2 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, Doctors without Borders Canada is providing emergency health services for up to 167,000 conflict affected people in Upper Nile and Jonglei states. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, including 38,000 malaria patients treated and 52,000 vaccinations; (2) providing sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including 6,684 post-natal consultations and 3,440 assisted deliveries;  and (3) providing secondary healthcare services, including 3,969 inpatient admissions and 1,400 malnutrition cases treated with therapeutic feeding.</description>

    <title>Emergency Funding in Africa - Sexual and Reproductive Health of Women and Girls - UNFPA 2019</title>
    <description>With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is contributing to meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable women and girls in Africa, and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. During conflicts, natural disasters and other complex emergencies, sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls must not be overlooked. It is essential to ensure life-saving interventions related to sexual and reproductive health services, and to provide protection from and response to sexual and gender-based violence for women and girls. This unearmarked regional funding provides UNFPA the flexibility to respond to emerging needs or underfunded operations throughout Africa.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency obstetric care, and sexual and reproductive health services to women and adolescent girls; (2) ensuring protection from and response to gender-based violence; and (3) providing health services, supplies, commodities and medication, dignity kits, and reproductive health kits to crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>UN Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples</title>
    <description>The project supports the United Nations (UN) Voluntary Fund to enhance the meaningful participation of Indigenous peoples at the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. These two key UN bodies are devoted to Indigenous issues, as well as the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Peoples and the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). These UN bodies facilitate the mechanisms to build the expertise of beneficiaries, enabling them to be effective participants in UN human rights mechanisms and more effective duty bearers within their respective communities through mentoring programs, information sessions and training.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased number of Indigenous peoples' participation in UN meetings and in decision-making processes; (2) increased representation of Indigenous women in UN meetings and processes as a means of empowering Indigenous women, including emerging leaders at the international level; (3) enhanced effectiveness of diverse information and views submitted to Treaty Bodies system and the UPR leading to the international Human Rights Mechanisms providing targeted expert advice on Indigenous issues and on related issues; and (4) increased advocacy by Indigenous peoples' representatives at local and national level.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2019) include: (1) 131 people (of which 76 were women) participated in key UN meetings and processes that were the most specific and relevant to the Indigenous peoples from developing countries, especially those affected by instability and/or conflict. For example, 45 Indigenous representatives from 35 countries attended the two weeks session of the UN Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples, and 23 representatives from 13 countries attended the Human Rights Council, Treaty Body, and Universal Periodic Review (UPR) sessions; (2) many initiatives were organized by the Indigenous representatives upon return to their home countries to raise awareness on these international processes. In some cases, in order to increase more awareness, important documents and reports from the different sessions were translated into national/local languages; and (3) the work of participants back home in building networks, exchanging information with other Indigenous peoples’ representatives and creating partnerships with other Indigenous peoples, governments, UN agencies, NGOs and experts was supported and strengthened.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Pathfinders Grand Challenge on inequality and exclusion</title>
    <description>This project seeks to find evidence-based solutions to political, economic, and social exclusion problems, to understand their links to conflict, and to unblock political obstacles to implementing these solutions. This project also supports institutions and countries in meeting 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development vision by working closely with countries emerging from conflict or facing conflict risk by seeking new government commitments. This project has two phases. The second phase activities include: (1) convening high-level member state representatives, senior policymakers, and renowned experts to discuss and contribute to a “challenge paper” for the grand challenge on inequality and exclusion; (2) producing and publishing a Challenge Paper to inform discussion and follow-up work on research, policy, and political level action throughout 2019 and beyond; and (3) supporting participating countries and organizations in developing work plans integrating gender equality analysis.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcome of this project is increased commitments by national governments and intergovernmental forums to equality and inclusive measures, including gender equality.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (February 2020) include: (1) established a strong cross-regional constituency supporting policies that promote equality and inclusion, including 13 countries representing 7 regions. They provide support to the Pathfinders Grand Challenge and cosponsor events, 4 high-profile multilateral organizations which have committed to participate in the Pathfinders Grand Challenge events and research, and 6 international civil society partners; (2) governments, multilateral, and civil society partners participated and contributed to the development and publishing of the Challenge Paper; and (3) partner organizations and civil society groups adapted their work in putting more investment into equality and inclusion and linking their work with others using the Pathfinders framework. For instance, they created 4 joint work plans with prominent multilateral and civil society organizations: the World Bank, OECD, OXFAM, and Open Society Forum. These plans incorporated gender equality-related analysis and political work, ensuring the inclusion of the gender equality agenda in diverse work streams of the Grand Challenge.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria - Prevention and Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse - IMO</title>
    <description>May 2018 – Years of active conflict and displacement inside Syria have resulted in severe protection risks, including widespread sexual and gender-based violence for millions of conflicted-affected people. Sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by humanitarian aid workers is a serious concern for the international humanitarian and development community, and represents one of the most egregious failures of protection. The prevention of and response to sexual exploitation and abuse by aid workers on beneficiaries is a priority of the United Nations Secretary General and the international community, to ensure that assistance does not harm beneficiaries.  With GAC’s support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) seeks to establish a systematic inter-agency approach between humanitarian organizations to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by aid workers within Syria. Project activities include: (1) strengthening codes of conduct of aid workers within humanitarian organizations; (2) developing, based on global best practices, a community-based complaints mechanism for beneficiaries that have been sexually exploited and/or abused by aid workers; and (3) establishing networks amongst humanitarian organizations inside Syria to manage the prevention of and response to sexual exploitation and abuse on beneficiaries by aid workers.</description>

    <title>DRC - Ebola Virus Disease  - UNICEF 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 - A new outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on May 8, 2018. Although it is too early to predict the trajectory of this outbreak, there are concerns regarding the containment and prevention of the virus as it has spread from three rural health zones to the provincial capital of Mbandaka, a large urban centre with national and international transportation routes, increasing the risk of it spreading further within the DRC and neighbouring countries. Based on lessons learned from the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, an early response is required to help mitigate and contain the spread.  With GAC’s support, UNICEF is helping to reduce and control the spread of the Ebola virus in DRC by basic health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection needs of persons infected by or at risk of contracting Ebola in the affected health zones. Project activities include: (1) equipping health care structures for the management of medical waste and building emergency latrines in health facilities in affected areas; (2) providing the health zone with care inputs and essential drugs to maintain access to basic health services; (3) distributing WASH kits to households, and pre-position disinfection equipment; and (4) providing psychosocial support to suspected cases and contacts.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies - World Health Organization 2019</title>
    <description>The Contingency Fund for Emergencies of the World Health Organization (WHO) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial, acute response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  The support of GAC and other donors to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies helps WHO react early to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess the threat of different outbreaks; and (2) initiating urgent activities to prevent the spread of outbreaks, such as the delivery of vital health supplies, the training of community health workers, the provision of potable water and the implementation of vaccination campaign.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Common Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.3 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.2 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, the South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund is providing timely allocations to national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies to meet critical humanitarian needs of people throughout the country. The Fund is managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office. Support to the Fund is helping to achieve its objectives, including: (1) promoting early action and response to reduce loss of life; (2) enhancing response to time-critical humanitarian requirements; and (3) strengthening core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Health, Nutrition and Protection in Colombia - ACF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is helping address the basic health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection needs of up to 14,100 crisis-affected people in the departments of Guajira and Norte de Santander in Columbia. Project activities include: (1) providing prenatal and postnatal health check-ups; (2) delivering safe drinking water by providing water filters at reception points; (3) providing nutritional assistance (screening and treatment) to up to 1,080 pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of five; (4) providing emergency cash-based transfers to vulnerable households; and (6) providing training on basic hygiene practices, and waste management , and promoting hygiene to up to 5,000 crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services in Colombia - IPPF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) is helping provide life-saving sexual and reproductive health services to up to 70,000 crisis-affected people in the departments of Arauca, Guajira and Norte de Santander in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health services, including the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) to up to 7,000 vulnerable people. The Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) is a series of crucial actions required to respond to reproductive health needs at the onset of every humanitarian crisis; (2) distributing essential medicines and contraceptives to service delivery points; and (3) conducting outreach in targeted communities on sexual and reproductive health and rights and prevention and response gender-based violence, reaching up to 18,000 people.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Health and Protection Services - IRC 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is helping address the basic health and protection needs of up to 5,100 crisis-affected people in the department of Norte de Santander in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing quality prenatal and postnatal care to up to 1,300 women and adolescent girls; (2) offering other sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning services and clinical care for vulnerable people and/or survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; (3) improving access to emergency care for up to 200 girls and boys under the age of five; (4) providing psychosocial services to crisis-affected people; (5) providing a safe space for up to 1,000 women and adolescent girls; and (6) providing emergency cash-based transfers to vulnerable households.</description>

    <title>Democratic Republic of Congo - Ebola Response - Canadian Red Cross 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - A 10th outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on August 1, 2018. North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the DRC. The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with limited access and over one million internally displaced people. The continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania, represents a risk of spreading the outbreak to other provinces and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is helping to meet the immediate needs of persons infected by or at risk of contracting Ebola in the affected health zones. The IFRC has the operational expertise for programmatic response, particularly in community engagement and accountability, psychosocial support, surveillance, and National Society Development. Project activities include: (1) conducting safe and dignified burials; (2) providing psychosocial support to Ebola patients and their families; (3) advocacy and community outreach on Ebola prevention, detection and control; and (4) advocating for humanitarian access to affected and at-risk communities.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis - Humanitarian Assistance in the DRC - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>October 2019 – The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been battling its 10th Ebola outbreak since August 1, 2018. It is second only to the 2014 West Africa outbreak in magnitude. As of September 11, 2019, there have been 3,099 cases of Ebola in the DRC with 2,074 deaths. In addition, four deaths were reported in Uganda between June and August 2019. On July 17, 2019, the WHO declared this outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”, a designation that indicates that a crisis has the potential for global reach.  With GAC’s support, this project aims to provide funding to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to bring together humanitarian actors and Congolese authorities in order to ensure a coherent response to the ongoing crisis. Project activities include: (1) advocating for multi-sectorial coordination for humanitarian response; (2) supporting operation readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries; and (3) strengthening the emergency telecommunications system.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis – Humanitarian Assistance to Displaced People – UNICEF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance including basic health support, food security and nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation assistance.  With GAC’s support, UNICEF is helping to reduce the vulnerability and maintain the dignity of displaced Venezuelans in various countries of South America and the Caribbean region. Project activities include: (1) increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; (2) providing basic healthcare; (3) treating children for severe acute malnutrition; (4) providing emergency education programming for children; and (5) ensuring protection services for children and women.</description>

    <title>Iraq Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>July 2019 – In 2019, there are an estimated 6.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq, 18% of the total population. More than 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced, despite the expulsion of ISIL from Iraqi territory in December 2017. Displaced people both in-camp and out-of-camp settings continue to depend on the provision of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages the Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF), which allocates resources to national and international humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of crisis-affected populations throughout Iraq. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving and life-sustaining activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination and leadership primarily through the Humanitarian Coordinator function, and by leveraging the humanitarian cluster system; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with national and international partners.</description>

    <title>DRC - Ebola Virus Disease – Doctors Without Borders - 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 - A new outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on May 8, 2018. Although it is too early to predict the trajectory of this outbreak, there are concerns regarding the containment and prevention of the virus as it has spread from three rural health zones to the provincial capital of Mbandaka, a large urban centre with national and international transportation routes, increasing the risk of it spreading further within the DRC and neighbouring countries. Based on lessons learned from the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, an early response is required to help mitigate and contain the spread.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is meeting the immediate medical needs of persons infected by, or at risk of contracting Ebola in the affected health zones. MSF specializes in emergency health services and is the lead on Ebola treatment in the DRC. Project activities include: (1) establishing Ebola treatment centres in affected health zones; (2) improving medical management of patients and suspected cases; (3) improving surveillance, case management and infection management and control; and (4) raising awareness and immunization of at-risk groups.</description>

    <title>Haiti - Emergency Cholera Response - Doctors of the World Canada 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 2.6 million people in Haiti will require humanitarian assistance in 2019, most of them affected by acute food insecurity. The ongoing cholera outbreak also remains a major threat to hundreds of thousands of families. In addition, economic fragility and socio-political tensions are affecting the population's ability to access basic services and have contributed to perpetuating a humanitarian crisis.  With GAC support, Doctors of the World Canada is helping to reduce morbidity and mortality related to the cholera epidemic. Project activities include: 1) providing support for emergency response to cholera outbreaks and the deployment of emergency medical teams; 2) strengthening the capacity of health authorities for the prevention and quality management of diarrheal diseases; 3) strengthening the epidemiological surveillance and early warning system for outbreaks.</description>

    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 2.6 million people in Haiti will require humanitarian assistance in 2019, most of them affected by acute food insecurity. The ongoing cholera outbreak also remains a major threat to hundreds of thousands of families. In addition, economic fragility and socio-political tensions are affecting the population's ability to access basic services and have contributed to perpetuating a humanitarian crisis situation.  With the support of GAC Canada, Solidarités International is working in collaboration with ACTED and Action contre la Faim (ACF). The project contributes to improving the immediate response to cases of diarrheal diseases. Project activities include: 1) providing support to the emergency response to cholera outbreaks; 2) installation of temporary water chlorination points in outbreak areas; 3) disinfecting affected households and distributing cholera prevention kits; 4) promoting awareness and training affected and at-risk populations, including community leaders, on disease prevention activities in the areas of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.</description>

    <title>Pakistan - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Pakistan continues to face multiple humanitarian crises, including conflict-induced displacement; a large contingent of Afghan refugees; high levels of malnutrition; and vulnerability to natural disasters. Since 2009, the country has experienced significant displacement of people as a result of the military-led security operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. For those who are able to return, conditions are difficult due to significant damage to community infrastructure, water supply systems and educational and health centres. The country is currently experiencing a severe drought affecting southern provinces.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) supports the Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund to provide timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations, as well as United Nations agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in Pakistan. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) strengthening coordination and leadership within the humanitarian response; (3) improving the relevance and coherence of the humanitarian response; and (4) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas. In 2019, key priority sectors include shelter, health, and water, sanitation and hygiene.</description>

    <title>Support for Evidence-Based Decision-Making and Assessment Capacities - 2019-2021</title>
    <description>This project, also known as the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS), aims to improve coordinated multi-sector needs assessments before, during, or after the humanitarian response to global humanitarian crises.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the project provides evidence-based analysis for decision-making during humanitarian crises. Project activities include: (1) developing innovative needs assessment methodologies and tools in order to provide faster, more precise and cost effective assessments of humanitarian crises; and (2) training organizations and experts to build a roster of trained deployable assessment experts.  This project is being implemented by a consortium of two international non-governmental organizations: Save the Children and the Norwegian Refugee Council.</description>

    <title>Integrating Gender Equity in Teacher Training (GETT) in Afghanistan</title>
    <description>The project aims to increase the supply of women teachers available to teach girls and boys in select regional schools by working with teacher training colleges (TTCs) in Afghanistan. The project contributes to the implementation of the gender equity commitments reflected in the quality assurance policies of Afghanistan’s Teacher Education Department, namely: (1) the provision of a sufficient number of qualified women teachers, and gender-sensitive teachers who are adequately prepared to improve the learning outcomes of girls and boys; (2) a gender equitable system to establish the qualification of teachers in TTCs; and (3) reduced gender-based discrimination in TTCs. Project activities include: (1) training TTC directors and faculty on gender-based analysis and human rights; (2) supporting TTC leaders to develop and implement gender-equitable policies and gender-sensitive courses, curriculum, and pedagogy; (3) providing career counselling on leadership and management to women instructors; and (4) supporting women TTC graduates in job seeking and job placement. This project works to improve gender responsiveness of leadership at select TTCs and to increase the supply of teachers, particularly women teachers, who apply gender-responsive pedagogies.</description>

    <title>International Parliamentarians' Conference on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights 2018</title>
    <description>Canada is hosting the International Parliamentarians’ Conference on 22-23 October 2018 in Ottawa. Approximately 500 participants are invited to attend, including over 300 parliamentarians from all regions of the world, representatives from the national, regional and global parliamentary groups and non-governmental organizations.  The event focuses on parliamentarian action and civil society collaboration toward universal sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), in contribution to the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development’s Programme of Action. It is co-organized by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) with the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development, the Inter-American Parliamentary Group on Population and Development, and Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, in collaboration with the Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Common Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2018</title>
    <description>As of March 2018, an estimated 7 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline, and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and over 2.4 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 5.1 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many conflict areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, the South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund is providing timely allocations to national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies to meet critical humanitarian needs of people throughout the country. The Fund is managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office. Support to the Fund is helping to achieve its objectives, including: (1) promoting early action and response to reduce loss of life; (2) enhancing response to time-critical humanitarian requirements; and (3) strengthening core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies - World Health Organization 2018</title>
    <description>The Contingency Fund for Emergencies of the World Health Organization (WHO) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  The support of GAC and other donors to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies helps WHO react early to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess the threat of different outbreaks; and (2) initiating urgent activities to prevent the spread of outbreaks, such as the delivery of vital health supplies, the training of community health workers, and the implementation of vaccination campaign.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and record hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans, and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security and nutrition and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, this project is helping address the basic food needs of up to 9,000 crisis-affected people in Venezuela. Project activities include: (1) providing school meals to vulnerable and at-risk children; (2) distributing family food rations to food-insecure households; and (3) providing agricultural inputs such as seeds and capacity building to increase food production.</description>

    <title>Support to the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding</title>
    <description>This project supports the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (IDPS). The IDPS is a unique forum for political dialogue that brings together a group of 20 countries affected by conflict and fragility, OECD donors, global financial institutions, and civil society organizations to improve the way that donors, lenders, civil society and national governments work together to pursue development, peace and security in fragile and conflict affected states. The IDPS drives political momentum for change through strong partnerships and mutual accountability for results. It provides support to the global voice of fragile states and promotes solutions based on country-ownership and a comprehensive approach to development and security issues. Project activities include: (1) convening the Steering Group Meeting of the IDPS (in Lisbon at the g7+ hub); (2) conducting in-depth country level dialogues among the IDPS constituencies; (3) Facilitating engagement between the IDPS constituencies; and (3) preparing a politically relevant and tangible IDPS contribution for the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) 2019, which focuses on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.</description>

    <title>Ukraine - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 3.4 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. The majority of people in need are located in the non-government controlled areas where access is challenging. Some 1.5 million people remain displaced and an average of 1.1 million people cross the contact line each month to access essential services. Protection is a key concern, with daily shelling, significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), managed Ukraine Humanitarian Pooled Fund, channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of conflict-affected populations. Project activities include: (1) providing needs-based assistance in line with priorities identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan; (2) strengthening partnerships with local and international non-governmental organizations; and (3) delivering humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas, focusing particularly on non-government controlled areas and the contact line.</description>

    <title>Enhanced respect, promotion and protection of human rights in the post-accord period in Colombia</title>
    <description>The project aims to help build a climate of security and stability as Colombia advances in its peacebuilding efforts. Project activities include: (1) supporting a robust United Nations (UN) human rights presence in post-accord Colombia that complements the peace and security work of the UN Political Mission; (2) supporting the work of Government of Colombia institutions and civil society groups who work for the promotion and protection of human rights; and (3) demonstrating the dividends of peace and laying the seeds for societal transformation given the critical nature of the short period immediately after the signing of a peace agreement.</description>

    <title>Supporting Children's Rights in Peace Agreement Implementation in Colombia</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the capacities and reach of local coordination teams in Colombia to monitor and report on the status of children from a gender and ethnicity perspective, in the context of declining security trends present in conflict-affected regions. This project also works to increase the capacities of the Colombian Transitional Justice mechanism on applying a gender and child focus, in analysing and processing cases involving children in transitional justice and historical memory processes, thus fostering a survivor-based approach that aims to promote effectiveness.</description>

    <title>Community Liaison and Risk Education in Support of Humanitarian Demining in Colombia</title>
    <description>This project aims to carry out community liaison activities that link local leaders (women and men) to the military demining units assigned to clear mines in their communities. These liaison activities work to contribute to ensuring that the needs and priorities of women and men from local populations are met by fostering the population’s active contributions to mine action identification and prioritization processes. The project also aims to provide mine risk education to vulnerable communities, including women and girls, in order to promote safe behaviors and reduce the incidence of landmine accidents and victims. This includes both communities where demining activities are occurring and communities where there have been recent incidents of landmine accidents but where security situations do not permit demining activities.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved mine risk awareness and safer behaviors on the part of women, girls, men and boys living in municipalities affected by landmines and other explosive remnants; and (2) improved effectiveness of humanitarian demining activities carried out by the Colombian military as a result of community liaison.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of September 2022 include: (1) 40,157 people (20,173 women and girls; and 19,984 men and boys) from 65 prioritized municipalities for humanitarian mine clearance by Colombian military brigades demonstrated improved mine risk awareness and safer behaviours. As a result, these municipalities reported zero landmine incidents during this period; (2) improved confidence and cooperation by local populations (including women and local authorities) with Colombian military demining brigades. The assigned brigades conducted humanitarian demining in their communities and contributed information on effectively prioritizing lands identified for mine clearance. This action included the provision of 110 reports of mine or explosive contaminated areas; and (3) authorities investigated 61% of the contamination reports by the end of the project.  </resultsAchieved>

    <title>Combatting Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo</title>
    <description>This project proposes supplementing the response to Ebola through stabilization and peacebuilding efforts. The project aims to help contain the spread of Ebola, and reduce the community's violent resistance and mistrust of the Ebola response in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project also aims to build trust between communities and non-medical state actors, such as elements of the police, loyalist members of the DRC armed forces, administrative officials and media leaders who play a key role in response activities. Interventions such as community dialogues and participatory theatre work to bring together key stakeholders, including women and youth, and reduce the security dilemma in favour of local government, thereby enhancing existing stabilization interventions. These activities take place in Butembo and Beni, North Kivu, where most of the Ebola crisis has spread and where community engagement can strategically support the Ebola response.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Internally displaced populations are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations throughout the year. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Mozambique - Emergency Response to Cyclone Idai - UNICEF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – On March 14, Cyclone Idai, a category 2 storm, made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, and continued its journey, causing significant loss of life, damage, flooding and displacement. The cyclone and its associated tropical depression will ultimately have claimed more than 800 lives and severely affected the livelihoods of more than 3 million people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.  In humanitarian emergencies, UNICEF’s project activities include: (1) providing people with access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; (2) treating children for severe acute malnutrition; (3) providing emergency education programming for children; (4) ensuring protection services for children and women; and (5) providing basic healthcare.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Emergency Health Care - Doctors Without Borders Canada 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 7.5 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.5 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.2 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.4 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders Canada is providing emergency health services for up to 164,000 conflict-affected people in Upper Nile and Jonglei states in South Sudan. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, including 32,500 outpatient consultations and vaccinating 30,000 children; (2) providing sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including 5,500 postnatal consultations and 2,600 assisted deliveries; and (3) providing secondary healthcare services, including 4,000 inpatient admissions and treating 900 malnutrition cases with therapeutic feeding.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Common Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) started to deteriorate in 2017. This has continued through late 2019, where a resurgence of direct confrontations between armed actors was observed. This, combined with continued insecurity, led to suspensions of movements of humanitarian actors, impacting the humanitarian response. CAR is one of the most dangerous contexts in the world for humanitarian workers. The crisis in CAR is very much a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and SGBV cases commonplace. Approximately 35% of the population is food insecure and only 50% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across the country that is controlled by armed groups continues to exacerbate displacement; currently, over one quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally (600,100) or as refugees in neighbouring countries (592,000).  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international NGOs as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. The CHF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national non-governmental organizations, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Supporting Criminal Justice and Localized Truth and Memory Processes in Support of the Peace Process</title>
    <description>This project aims to support the Transitional Justice mechanisms established under the Colombian Peace Agreements by working with authorities to ensure that the design and implementation of the mechanisms are consistent with international standards and best practices, as well as to ensure the effective realisation of victims’ rights. Furthermore, the project supports civil society and victims’ organizations at the local levels in the Department of La Guajira and Cesar (departments heavily impacted by the conflict) to develop and implement local truth and reconciliation processes.</description>

    <title>Improving Dialogue on Security Governance  for Yemen</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve sustainability and inclusivity of the peace process and Security Sector Reform and Governance Security Sector Reform and Governance (SSR/G) in Yemen. The project works to achieve this through conducting a series of dialogue sessions that aim to bring together Yemeni stakeholders to address challenges, and focus on reforming the security sector. Addressing immediate security issues and arrangements are a first priority for the dialogues. However, framing the way these are addressed within the longer-term SSR/G vision incentivise the parties to make progress in the short-term. The specific objectives of the project are centered on tangible progress in terms of shared understandings related to the necessary arrangements that may help progress towards an end to the current conflict, even if only through lowering tensions and stopping the actual fighting.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased implementation of key elements (security sector), including gender-responsiveness, to enable progress in peace talks and conflict resolution, based on a long-term SSR/G vision; (2) improved common understanding of security arrangements &amp; concerns, including gender concerns both immediate and long-term; and (3) increased knowledge and awareness of SSR/G and its added value in a peace process among Yemeni actors.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (November 2021) include:  (1) conducted nine dialogue sessions, with the final six held virtually. These dialogues identified security sector reforms and concerns surrounding governance; (2) The Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance (DCAF) also conducted  four training sessions to enhance the capacity of 15 Yemeni women experts. These women are already active in the ongoing reform of the security sector as part of the transition process; (3) the training focused on enhancing their knowledge of gender considerations of security arrangements, disarmament demobilization and reintegration (DDR), and aspects of security sector reform (SSR), as they relate to the Yemeni context; and (4) strengthened their capacity to apply lessons learned in conflict transitions to the Yemeni context.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Engendering Equality: Increasing Women’s Political Participation in Sudan</title>
    <description>This project aims to create a strategic mechanism to enhance women’s meaningful participation in Sudan’s political transition, and strengthen coordination among women’s organizations across Sudan. The project works to establish five regional gender equality networks (GENs) and meet regularly to provide a forum for regional information exchange on key transition issues. Capacity strengthening for elected GEN allows for the improvement in their ability to represent their local constituencies both locally and nationally. This project also aims to sensitize community members and leadership about the importance of gender equality and women’s participation in political life. Project activities include: (1) countering discriminatory discourses through an increased understanding of Islam; and (2) providing information on justice and gender equality and their associated national and international policies.</description>

    <title>Ebola Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo - WFP UNHAS 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 - A new outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on May 8, 2018. Although it is too early to predict the trajectory of this outbreak, there are concerns regarding the containment and prevention of the virus as it has spread from three rural health zones to the provincial capital of Mbandaka, a large urban centre with national and international transportation routes, increasing the risk of it spreading further within the DRC and neighbouring countries. Based on lessons learned from the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, an early response is required to help mitigate and contain the spread. With GAC’s support, the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) managed by the World Food Programme (WFP) is helping to reduce and control the spread of the Ebola virus in DRC by responding to the logistical needs of the humanitarian community. Project activities include: (1) supporting logistical systems; and (2) providing air support services to enable efficient and effective humanitarian response.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Health and Nutrition Response - 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and record hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans, and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security and nutrition and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, the organization helps provide life-saving assistance to vulnerable and communities affected by the Venezuela crisis. Project activities include: (1) providing basic health services, including vaccination, prenatal and postnatal care; (2) distributing essential medication and medical supplies to health facilities; and (3) providing nutritional support to vulnerable and at-risk people.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - Development and Peace 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, there are approximately 855,000 Rohingya refugees living in 34 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace and its local partner, Caritas Bangladesh, are providing safe shelters and secure settlements to Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, using a community-based approach. Project activities include: (1) providing training on shelter construction, maintenance and upgrade to refugee households; (2) distributing construction and technical assistance materials; (3) facilitating community groups to develop site improvement action plans; and (4) undertaking site improvement works.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Emergency Services - Development and Peace 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, Development and Peace is helping to improve the health of over 8,000 people affected by the Venezuelan crisis in the departments of Valle del Cauca, Arauca and Nariño in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter services to more than 5,000 people affected by the crisis; (2) providing hygiene and dignity kits to Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the shelters; (3) providing psychological and legal counselling to more than 3,000 people affected by the crisis; and (4) providing transportation services to vulnerable Venezuelan migrants and refugees.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, Doctors of the World is helping to improve the health of over 40,000 people affected by the Venezuelan crisis in the departments of Nariño and Cundinamarca in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health services to approximately 2,000 vulnerable women and adolescent girls; (2) providing medical, mental health and psychosocial counselling to more than 3,000 people affected by the crisis; (3) providing training to health personnel on managing health care for the migrant population; and (4) providing training to community organizations on the right to health, gender equality, xenophobia, violence prevention, and sexual exploitation.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens, and heavily impacting the ability of people to meet basic needs. Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  With GAC's support, this project is helping address the lifesaving nutrition needs of up to 66,000 crisis-affected people in the region, particularly women and children. Project activities include: (1) providing nutritional assistance to crisis-affected people; (2) providing training on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and nutritional assistance to local organizations and communities; and (3) facilitating peer group counselling sessions.</description>

    <title>Lebanon - Response to Explosion in Beirut - UNFPA 2020</title>
    <description>August 2020 - In response to new and exacerbated humanitarian needs in Lebanon following the August 4, 2020 explosions at the Port of Beirut, the United Nations launched a flash appeal to respond to the needs of 300,000 people in Lebanon affected by the explosions until November 2020. The appeal outlines a coordinated humanitarian response to the most immediate and lifesaving needs, including provision of essential health care, food, water, hygiene, shelter and protection to people affected by the explosions.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is scaling up its emergency response to provide integrated sexual and reproductive healthcare, including emergency obstetric and neonatal care, gender-based violence (GBV) services that include psychological first aid, psychosocial counselling, mental health services, legal assistance, and case management. Project activities include: (1) ensuring the continuity of life-saving services, including emergency obstetric and neonatal care, and the minimum initial services package for reproductive health in emergencies; (2) procuring medical equipment and supplies for maternity departments and affected health facilities; and (3) providing life-saving GBV services, including psychological first aid, clinical management of sexual violence, and long-term counselling.</description>

    <title>Livelihood Support and Women's Empowerment in Cox's Bazaar-COVID 19</title>
    <description>This project aims to decrease coronavirus (COVID-19) related mortality and morbidity, among affected populations, especially those experiencing marginalization and/or vulnerability in Cox’s Bazar. The project works to mitigate the risk of community spread and increase local response capacity. Bangladesh is at a high risk given its slow response to the pandemic, weak health care system capacity, and high population density. For the host communities in Cox’s Bazar, the second poorest and most vulnerable district in Bangladesh even before the influx of the Rohingya in August 2017, COVID-19 has put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services, which were already scarce and overstretched. In addition, there are major concerns around a large-scale COVID-19 outbreak in the dense Rohingya refugee camps, due to limited health system capacity, and increasing restrictions on humanitarian access to the camps. Project activities include: (1) procuring and distributing medical equipment and medical supplies (cleaning materials, soap, paper towels, tables, chairs, benches, beds, fans, desks, lights, floor mats, etc.) for health facilities; (2) providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical professionals in primary healthcare centers in the refugee camps; (3) distributing masks, soap, and sanitizer supplies to community health workers and clients visiting health centers; (4) providing capacity building and training on case management and infection prevention and control to public health care professionals and service providers (doctors, midwives, paramedics, lab technicians, etc.); (5) providing communication and community engagement measures such as, training on effective engagement in case management, infection prevention, and risk reduction and awareness, particularly by women health workers communication actions at the district, divisional and national levels, including providing up-to-date information on COVID-19 to doctors and field support teams at the community level; and (6) organizing door-to-door awareness building sessions for self-reporting and maintaining social distancing within communities.  The projects’ ongoing engagement with relevant civil society, government, and community stakeholders are expected to directly benefit approximately 8,132 individuals (of which 7,587 are women).</description>

    <title>Protecting Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in the Philippines - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>The project aims to lessen the damages caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on poor and marginalized women and girls in Manila and surrounding areas. Aligned with the Government of the Philippines’ pandemic response, the project works to help reduce the impact of COVID-19 on women and girls by improving the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, and the response to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).  Project activities include: (1) improving access to comprehensive SRHR services for women and girls by providing family planning, ante-natal and post-natal services, screening for sexually transmitted infections, SGBV detection and counselling, and cervical cancer screening and treatment; (2) organizing capacity building for local women’s rights organizations (WROs), and better coordination of WROs, civil society organizations, community mobilizers (CMs) and community health providers (CHPs) who work to lead community outreach and education activities; (3) providing training to clinic staff, CMs and CHPs to better detect SGBV, offering counselling and providing referrals in-person, online or through a telehealth system; (4) disseminating COVID-19 information and resources by CMs and CHPs; and (5) engaging clinic staff with community leaders and government stakeholders to better coordinate information sharing and SRHR, SGBV and COVID-19 responses.  The project expects to benefit 60,460 community members, including 54,353 women and girls, in Metro Manila and surrounding areas particularly affected by the pandemic.</description>

    <title>Emergency support - UNHCR - 2019</title>
    <description>October 2019 – Over the course of 2019, there has been increased insecurity in northern and eastern Burkina Faso, including attacks against civilians. This insecurity has contributed to significant population displacements, with almost 290,000 people fleeing their homes and finding refuge in neighboring communities, as of September 2019. These rapid population displacements caused severe loss of livelihoods, stress on host communities’ existing resources, and food insecurity.  More than 1.5 million Burkinabés are now in need of humanitarian assistance with over 1.2 million people who are food insecure and close to 600,000 in need of nutrition assistance. In addition to the food and nutrition needs, which have more than quadrupled over the course of 2019, specific needs for shelter and household goods, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection and health services also more than doubled, especially for displaced and host communities.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally displaced persons.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the project aims to provide assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in Burkina Faso.  Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, child protection and working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and help issue identity documents; (5) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance and forge peaceful relations between refugees and local citizens; and (6) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for people of concern</description>

    <title>Women’s Voice and Leadership - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Senegal</title>
    <description>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project supports Senegalese women’s rights organizations to allow them to better respond to the needs of women and girls, including those most marginalized, who are at risk of being disproportionally impacted by this crisis, from a health, social, and economic perspective.  Project activities include: (1) conducting an impact and follow-up study on the risk reduction measures of COVID-19 on gender-based violence and the agency of women and girls; (2) providing prevention and psychosocial care for victims of gender-based violence and for women healthcare workers during the crisis; (3) conducting a media campaign on the unequal impacts of COVID-19 on women and girls; (4) raising awareness campaign on hygiene and the specific needs of women and girls, and distribution of hygiene kits responding to their needs; and (5) providing financial support to women's economic associations that are the most vulnerable to the crisis.  This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organizations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting their activities, building their institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the significant, globally recognized gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  This project is implemented by the Centre d’étude et de coopération internationale (CECI).  It directly supports 20 women's rights organizations at the local level, and 5 networks representing more than 20 organizations each.  In addition, the project enables women's organisations to adopt innovative management practices that contribute to the sustainability of their programmes, ensure better quality of services offered, and carry out networking, advocacy and social monitoring activities through innovative approaches that indirectly benefit more than 100,000 people in the country.</description>

    <title>Gender-Responsive Education and Transformation - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve equal learning outcomes for girls and boys at the primary school level in Ghana, Mozambique and Rwanda, in the context of COVID-19. Project activities include: (1) developing learning content for radio and television broadcasting to promote returning to school and to mitigate dropout risks for girls; (2) sensitizing girls on mechanisms for self-protection against sexual and gender-based violence; (3) mapping and strengthening existing community and school referral systems for sexual and gender-based violence and child rights abuse; (4) sensitizing community leaders on supporting girls that are unable to access education; (5) conducting refresher trainings to teachers on gender-responsive play-based learning; and (6) capacitating teachers on gender equality, child protection, and safeguarding in crisis contexts.  Project beneficiaries include 307,506 children (of which 168,825 are girls), and 231,500 community members, including teachers, mothers, fathers and caregivers in all three countries.</description>

    <title>Girls’ Education for a Better Future in the Great Lakes Region - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project supports the previously funded  project, “Girls' Education for a Better Future in the Great Lakes Region” (EDUFAM), to respond to issues that have been further exacerbated by the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis in  Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda. These activities work to particularly protect girls and adolescent girls from violence and exploitation, and ensure that they can continue in their education, through mitigating additional barriers caused by COVID-19. Project activities include: (1) replicating and disseminating official messages from governments and the World Health Organization to target communities; (2) disseminating awareness-raising messages to parents and students, especially on the radio, particularly to girls and adolescent girls on the importance of following national distance learning programs; (3) providing  teaching materials to identified girls and adolescents girls, and schools; (4) assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on the schooling of project beneficiaries and on the prevalence of sexual gender based violence (SGBV) in the targeted communities; (5) consulting with and strengthening education stakeholders to prepare for the reopening of schools; and (6) raising awareness and mobilizing communities on the prevention and care of SGBV, especially for girls and adolescent girls who have left school, as well as on the reintegration of children in school, in particular the refugee, displaced, returning and disabled girls and adolescents girls.</description>

    <title>Advancing Gender Equality in the Humanitrian Context of the Rohingya Refugee Crisis</title>
    <description>The project seeks to address gender inequality, and the prevention and response to gender-based violence in the humanitarian response to the Rohingya refugee crisis, through three objectives: (1) advance gender equality in humanitarian response programming; (2) support Canada’s leadership role in the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that works to transform the way gender-based violence is addressed in humanitarian emergencies; and (3) protect and empower displaced adolescent girls living in Cox’s Bazar.  Project activities for the Rohingya refugee crisis response include: (1) conducting, drafting and promoting a gender operational review of the Rohingya response; (2) generating girl-centered evidence; and (3) providing a comprehensive appreciation of attitudes and perceptions about adolescent girls living in Cox’s Bazar.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Protect the Rights of Women with Disabilities - AISHA 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 – Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the Aisha Association for Woman and Child Protection (AISHA) is helping to alleviate suffering, protect and maintain human dignity, and save lives for internally displaced and refugees, particularly women with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 59, in the poorest localities in the five governorates of Gaza. Project activities include: (1) providing capacity building to 25 women and 25 men from service providers working with women with disabilities in local authorities; (2) producing media and publicity materials (radio spot, radio sessions, billboards, social media tools, fact sheet) disseminated for service providers, community and women with disabilities on principles, good practice, and effectiveness of humanitarian response; (3) providing psychological group counselling sessions and open days to 600 women with disabilities and individual counselling sessions provided via the gender-based violence (GBV) mobile clinic to 50 women with disabilities; (4) providing substance abuse and GBV mental health medication to 20 women with disabilities at the AISHA Clinic; and (5) providing referral protection and case management services through specialized protection facilities and networks to 50 women with disabilities.</description>

    <title>Supporting Distance Learning in Response to COVID-19 in Sierra Leone and Liberia</title>
    <description>The project aims to support education for marginalized populations in Sierra Leone and Liberia in response to school closures and learning losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project’s innovative approach harnesses proven resources from traditional education programs with proven communication methods used in the agricultural sector through rural radio. Project activities include: (1) developing and distributing family literacy kits, including books and a parent’s lesson plan to households in the target regions; (2) providing up-to-date and evidence-based information about COVID-19 transmission prevention; and (3) developing and transmitting radio programs including gender-responsive and learner-centred content for primary school students and their families.  Project beneficiaries include approximately 70,000 children (50% of whom are girls), approximately 350,000 members of their families (of whom 50% are women), and 2,100 teachers (840F; 1,260M).  The project will indirectly reach up to 637,837 Liberians (of whom 50% are women) and 687,989 Sierra Leoneans (of whom 50% are women) who live in the districts covered by the program and with access to the radio broadcasts.</description>

    <title>Providing Home-Grown Nutritious School Meals to Primary School Children</title>
    <description>This project aims to provide nutritious and safe school meals to vulnerable primary school children in Sri Lanka. These meals are locally sourced and sustainable as a result of market linkages with local smallholder farmers, particularly women. Project activities include: (1) providing nutrition-sensitive home-gardening kits and training on climate-smart agriculture and financial management to women farmers; (2) creating market linkages between school meal suppliers and poultry farmers; (3) raising awareness of school principals, teachers and students on gender equality, nutrition and healthy diets; and (4) promoting healthy habits, such as hand washing, in schools. This project expects to directly benefit 1,700 women farmers and 170,000 primary grade school children in 10 districts in the North, East and North Central provinces.</description>

    <title>Urgent Rehabilitation Services and Psycho-Social Support in Gaza - Humanity and Inclusion 2018</title>
    <description>July 2018 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, Humanity and Inclusion is helping to address urgent post-operative and rehabilitation care needs in Gaza’s five governorates by providing outreach and center-based multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services for vulnerable Palestinians. These services include wound care, first rehabilitation responses, as well as individualized and collective psychosocial support to persons with injuries and their caretakers. The project also entails the procurement and provision of requisite assistive devices for persons with injuries and the capacity building of outreach teams on trauma management, amputation rehabilitation, burn and wound management and rehabilitation, and psychological first aid, so that they can provide standardized lifesaving care. The project collaborates with various actors and clusters to ensure an inclusive and coordinated response that takes cognizance of the needs of persons with disabilities.  Project activities include: (1) providing multidisciplinary nursing care, rehabilitation and psychosocial services to persons with injuries and caretakers; (2) procuring and distributing specific assistive devices to beneficiaries; (3) referring persons with injuries to service providers to address other specific needs; (4) providing training for caretakers on basic home-based rehabilitation and follow up exercises; and (5) providing training for caregiver facilitators on the provision of peer to peer psychosocial support conducted.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Coordination and Advocacy - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) works with local and international relief organizations and agencies to facilitate the coordination of effective and principled humanitarian action and advocacy to help alleviate human suffering and promote the rights of people in need.  Project activities include: (1) enhancing situational awareness of humanitarian stakeholders through preparing reports, briefings, maps, fact sheets, tours, and analyses, including gender-specific needs and vulnerabilities; (2) planning and monitoring humanitarian responses, including conducting analyses of vulnerability to best prioritize needs and better integrating gender mainstreaming and community engagement into the response structure; (3) strengthening the coordination mechanisms to ensure effective and coherent delivery of humanitarian assistance and encourage the participation of local non-governmental organizations and women’s groups; (4) coordinating and managing the Humanitarian Programming Cycle, including planning, monitoring, and improved gender mainstreaming; (5) continuing to advocate for humanitarian access and space, and protection from harm; and (6) supporting emergency preparedness and response planning efforts.</description>

    <title>Advancing Learning and Innovation on Gender Norms</title>
    <description>The project supports the work of the Overseas Development Institute’s Advancing Learning and Innovation on Gender Norms (ALIGN) platform. ALIGN works to strengthen the evidence base on harmful and discriminatory gender norms that are impeding progress on gender equality, and what works to change them.  Project activities include: (1) curating, generating, and synthesizing evidence on harmful and discriminatory gender norms to publish on the ALIGN digital platform, which is open and publicly accessible; (2) running a call for proposals as part of the ALIGN platform’s micro-granting facility, to support organizations in the Global South to conduct research and convene dialogues on gender norms with key stakeholders; and (3) providing capacity-building support to researchers and conveners to generate and communicate evidence to change harmful gender norms in their local contexts.</description>

    <description>July 2018 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is helping to improve access to essential maternal and child healthcare services, for high-risk pregnant and lactating women and children in Gaza. Project activities include: (1) procuring essential drugs and medical consumables; and (2) providing targeted post-natal home visiting services to high-risk pregnant, lactating women and newborns, who are unable to access services in hospitals due to the existing overload.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Response in Gaza - Save the Children Canada 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is helping to respond to the deterioration of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in Gaza by improving household water supply. Project activities include: (1) procuring and installing 1,000 polyethylene water tanks in 1,000 households; (2) distributing reverse osmosis filters to 50 of the most vulnerable households; (3) providing three municipal water wells with solar energy pumps; (4) providing technical assistance to municipalities on providing WASH services; (5) conducting 50 hygiene promotion sessions, including on menstrual hygiene management; and (6) distributing 1,500 hygiene kits with special consideration for the hygiene needs of women and girls.</description>

    <title>Mainstreaming Gender Equality in the management of Caribbean Fisheries</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve governance for gender-responsive fisheries in the Caribbean and enhance fisheries management particularly for women, girls and youth. This project supports the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), an institution of CARICOM. With this support, the CRFM is working with Caribbean countries to collect and analyse data to update or develop the national fisheries sector plans to mainstream gender equality, decent work, and youth considerations. This project facilitates engagement with both government and non-government entities to ensure the representation of women and youth in key decision-making positions/platforms, and to collect gender-related data on the contribution of fisheries to food security, income, and employment.</description>

    <description>This project is part of the Civilian Deployments Platform, which provides Canadian experts to organizations to support increased peace, security and stability.  This project focuses on women and girls, in fragile and conflict-affected states. The project deploys experts from Correctional Services Canada, coordinating two to three week missions in multiple countries such as Benin, Central African Republic and Haiti. These missions respond to training requests from the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The training includes UN pre-deployment training, effective practices for gender-responsive treatment of women prisoners training and basic instructional techniques training.</description>

    <title>Support to Transitional Justice in Syria - Phase II</title>
    <description>This project continues to support the capacity development of 17 Syrian civil society organizations that make up the Transitional Justice Coordination Group (TJCG). Support works to build the capacity of the TJCG to seek justice for crimes committed in Syria, through multilateral organizations and national courts. Capacity development support focuses on organizing networks, documenting violations of crimes in Syria, and amplifying the voices of former regime detainees. The project also focuses on establishing a platform for women survivors of detainment, and creating a database to document cases of abuse in Syrian prisons. Project activities include: (1) building on the work of the organisation “The Day After”; and (2) addressing key transitional justice issues, which need to be resolved for a durable political solution to take hold.</description>

    <title>Gendered Analysis of the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index</title>
    <description>The project aims to strengthen the evidence base on how women and girls experience poverty differently than men and boys by conducting a gender-based analysis of the data underpinning the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). The MPI is a measure of acute multidimensional poverty developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and included as part of the United Nations Human Development Report since 2010.  Project activities include: (1) conducting a gender-based analysis of the MPI indicators where the data permits, specifically, adult nutrition, years of schooling, and child school attendance; (2) publishing data tables and methodological notes from this analysis to equip researchers and national offices of statistics to replicate this methodology in their local contexts; and (3) developing communications materials, including country-specific briefs and presentations, to discuss the findings with national policymakers.</description>

    <title>Resilient, Inclusive, and Safe Education for Children</title>
    <description>This project contributes to children enjoying their right to quality education during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, by facilitating education continuity for vulnerable girls and boys between the ages of 6 and 12. This project also supports learning for deprived out-of-school girls and boys living in care institutions. Project activities include: (1) increasing access to resources by distributing learning materials and gadgets, as well as establishing community-based learning corners; (2) developing a gender-equitable parenting program that tackles the role of fathers in caregiving, women’s decision making, and violence prevention; (3) providing training to teachers and school heads on gender-responsive technical products and learning materials to strengthen their capacity to deliver quality distance-based education; (4) piloting a home-based assessment with the Department of Education to monitor children’s learning and well-being; and (5) establishing communication platforms for meaningful household-school-community engagement. This project expects to benefit 51,595 children, parents/caregivers, school administrators/teachers and local government officials, of which 24,848 are girls and 2,360 are women.</description>

    <title>Afro-Colombian Initiative for Gender Justice and Peace</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to the implementation of the Ethnic Chapter of the Colombian Peace Agreement through a feminist lens. The project also works to address the increase in post- Peace Agreement violence, particularly sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against Afro-Colombian women and girls in Barbacoas, Buenaventura, the Caribe, Norte de Cauca, and Tumaco regions. Project activities include: (1) conducting awareness raising activities on SGBV committed against Afro-Colombian women and girls; (2) increasing knowledge on services for survivors of SGBV, including domestic violence, through the publication and distribution of coronavirus (COVID-19) prevention and response materials; (3) conducting workshops to improve responses to SGBV by authorities and civil society operating in the focus regions of the project; (4) preparing and submitting to the Special Jurisdiction for Peace of an emblematic case on SGBV committed against Afro-Colombian women and girls; (5) holding community hearings on SGBV that promote healing and reconciliation; and (6) advocating for the continued implementation of the Ethnic Chapter through an Afro-Colombian feminist lens.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2022) include : (1) documented and analyzed141 cases of gender-based violence against Afro-Colombian people, primarily women and girls, to identify patterns of practice; (2) increased actions taken by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) in recognizing the violence carried out during Colombia’s international conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia against ethnic groups, primarily Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people. This includes a public announcement by the JEP in February 2022 to open three new macro-cases to investigate crimes carried out by the conflict’s armed actors. These crimes include massacres, selective and indiscriminate murders against ethnic people and territories, sexual and gender-based violence, homicides, selective assassinations, forced displacements and disappearances; and (3) carried out briefings and advocacy with national and international stakeholders, resulting in numerous statements by state and multilateral organizations voicing concerns about the security of women and men social leaders and calls to action to implement the gender and racial provisions of the peace agreement.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Protection in the North-West and South-West Regions - Plan Canada 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 -  Cameroon is experiencing three distinct humanitarian crises in 2021 that include: (1) violence in northeastern Nigeria, cross-border raids and suicide attacks have caused massive displacements in the Far North region; (2) conflict and insecurity in the Central African Republic continue to cause an influx of refugees east of the country; and (3) insecurity in the North-West and South-West regions has led to massive internal displacement. In 2021, at least 4 million people in Cameroon would require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic survival and protection needs exacerbated by the  coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negative impact. With GAC's support, Plan Canada is addressing the urgent child protection and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) needs of 20,380 internally displaced people and other conflict-affected people in the North West and South West regions. Project activities include: (1) establishing equipped safe Child and Adolescent-Friendly Spaces with gender-responsive and accessible improved latrines, handwashing facilities and water supply; (2) providing comprehensive age- and gender-responsive and inclusive case management support services; (3) delivering family tracing and reunification support to unaccompanied and separated children; (4) distributing in-kind safety kits to at-risk adolescent girls, young women and SGBV survivors; and (5) conducting community awareness campaigns on COVID-19 prevention, hygiene promotion and menstrual hygiene management.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Export Control Regimes for Strategic Goods in China</title>
    <description>This project aims to facilitate the provision of international expertise to a comprehensive, multi-year review by China of its control of trade in strategic goods.  This review is intended to focus especially on proliferation-sensitive goods and technologies related to weapons of mass destruction, such as North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Project activities include: (1) producing an initial report on China’s existing strategic trade control systems; (2) developing a toolkit on government-industry outreach and internal compliance programs within relevant industries; and (3) delivering a series of capacity-building workshops on government outreach to industry on strategic trade controls and compliance in China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) presidential and legislative elections of 2020-2021 are held in peaceful circumstances, and the electoral process is deemed credible and transparent by all stakeholders; and (2) large numbers of Côte d’Ivoire citizens freely exercise their right to vote in the 2020 to 2023 presidential and legislative elections.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2023) : (1) early warning systems received and processed 1,467 reports of electoral incidents; (2) 3,906 local commissioners and 6,500 agents improved their capacity to review the 2020 and 2023 electoral roll; (3) 500,000 women sensitized on the importance of registering to vote to ensure their voice is heard; (4) consensual decision-making achieved on at least 3 major issues between stakeholders in the electoral process, such as extending the voter registration period; and (5) 4 inter-party Concertation frameworks set up for democratic elections (CIED), in anticipation of the 2023 elections, in localities that had experienced violence to strengthen dialogue between political parties at local level. These results have contributed to the appeasement and inclusiveness of the 2020 and 2023 electoral cycles.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - HOPE 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 – A complex combination of vulnerability to armed conflict, inter-communal tension, protracted displacement, and food insecurity characterizes the humanitarian situation in Myanmar. An estimated one million crisis-affected people require humanitarian assistance this year, including more than 336,000 displaced people across the country. Humanitarian organizations operate in an increasingly complex environment, including as a result of the recent military coup.  With GAC’s support, HOPE International Development Agency and its local partner, Metta Development Foundation, support cash programming, health and nutrition, and access to gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health for internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in Kachin State, Myanmar. Project activities include: (1) distributing multi-purpose cash grants to former IDPs returning to their homes, including in support of supplementary feeding for children; (2) providing vocational and technical livelihood training to survivors of gender-based violence; and (3) facilitating comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) training for IDPs.</description>

    <title>Supporting the right to identity</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the protection environment of host populations in Burkina Faso’s Centre-Nord, Nord and Boucle du Mouhoun regions. It aims to provide the most vulnerable groups, including internally displaced persons at risk of statelessness, with access to identity documents (birth certificates and national identity cards). These documents facilitate their freedom of movement without risk of arrest and detention. It also allows them to access basic social services (education, health and the right to entrepreneurship) and to fully enjoy their citizenship. This project aims to provide 50,000 identity documents to children, women and men who are affected by the crisis in Burkina Faso, particularly internally displaced persons and the communities that welcome them.</description>

    <title>République centrafricaine - Assistance d’urgence - ACF – 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) started to deteriorate at an alarming rate in 2017. This trend continued through 2018, which saw a spike in attacks against peacekeepers and civilians alike, mass looting, widespread banditry, and territorial conflicts between armed groups. The crisis in CAR is in essence a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and SGBV cases commonplace. Approximately 40% of the population is food insecure and only 54% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across the 80% of the country that is controlled by armed groups continues to exacerbate displacement; currently, one quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally or as refugees in neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 38,450 conflict-affected people in Basse-Kotto prefecture, CAR. This project focuses on improving access to clean water, preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing basic reproductive health services to displaced women. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 12 water points; (2) providing sexual and reproductive health services to up to 877 women and girls; and (3) screening and/or treating up to 1,184 children suffering from severe or moderate acute malnutrition.</description>

GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international NGOs as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. Project activities include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national non-governmental organizations, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Tigray Crisis - Emergency Assistance (Sudan) - UNHCR 2020</title>
    <description>November 2020 - Due to the military confrontations in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, thousands of refugees have crossed the border to seek refuge in Sudan. UNHCR and other humanitarian partners have issued an interagency response plan to provide lifesaving protection and humanitarian assistance support to the incoming refugees from Ethiopia.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally displaced persons. The UNHCR searches for lasting solutions to their situations. With the support of GAC and other donors, the project provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance and international protection to refugees from Ethiopia in Sudan.  Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, child protection and working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and help issue identity documents; (5) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance and forge peaceful relations between refugees and local citizens; and (6) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for people of concern.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected People in Nigeria - Mission Inclusion 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Nearly twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation, or healthcare and widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, an estimated 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Mission Inclusion is helping to reduce vulnerability to and address the impacts of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amongst women and girls affected by conflict and insecurity in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing case-management and other services to survivors of SGBV and others at-risk; (2) providing cash or income-generating opportunities to vulnerable women and girls; and (3) engaging with local stakeholders to reduce incidence of and improve response to SGBV and other protection risks.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected People in North-East Nigeria - Plan 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Nearly twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation, or healthcare and widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, an estimated 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Plan is improving access to healthcare, particularly sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, and protection for conflict-affected internally displaced persons and host communities in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support to local health facilities; (2) providing case-management and other services to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV); and (3) engaging with community stakeholders to improve reporting of and response to SGBV and other protection risks.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People in Ethiopia - Save the Children 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Prior to the outbreak of conflict in the Tigray region in late 2020, Ethiopia was already facing ongoing acute humanitarian need, arising from sporadic but widespread intercommunal conflict, regional drought and flooding, swarms of desert locusts, the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of hosting nearly 800,000 refugees throughout the country. Together, these crises have led to widespread food insecurity, high levels of acute malnutrition, and significant population displacement. Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children is preventing and treating acute malnutrition, improving access to healthcare, and increasing the availability of safe water and sanitation amongst drought- and conflict-affected internally displaced persons (IDP) and host communities in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health facilities; (2) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; and (3) rehabilitating or constructing water points and sanitation facilities at health centres and in IDP settlements.</description>

    <title>Emergency support to WFP  - Sub-Saharan</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The Grand Sud region of Madagascar faces a severe food security and nutrition crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation by driving up the price of essential products and restricting inter-regional travel negatively impacting livelihoods and reducing overall household income. An estimated 1.14 million people in the Grand Sud region and 203,453 people in the Southeast of the country require humanitarian assistance from January to April 2021.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the World Food Programme (WFP) provides additional food assistance to more than 891,000 crisis-affected people until June 2021, the end of the lean season. Project activities include: (1) distributing emergency food assistance through cash-based transfers; (2) treating moderate and acute malnutrition for children under the age of five, including pregnant and lactating women; (3) launching emergency school feeding programs in the country.</description>

Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, HelpAge is ensuring access to life-saving health, nutrition, and protection services for elderly, disabled, or house-bound South Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopia’s Gambella region. Project activities include: (1) providing home-based health and nutrition services to elderly, disabled, or vulnerable refugees; (2) providing fresh food rations to nutritionally vulnerable elderly refugees; and (3) providing case-management and other protection services for elderly or vulnerable refugees.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Protection and SRHR Response in Jordan - IRC 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - With the Syria crisis in its tenth year, Jordan continues to host an estimated 1.2 million Syrian refugees in camps and host communities, of which over 660,000 registered. Other affected populations include 58,000 Iraqis, including a small number of unregistered refugees and those from Yemen. Crisis-affected populations require continued assistance to address essential humanitarian and protection needs.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection services and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) support to refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (3) providing training to women community leadership groups; (4) conducting engagement sessions with men and boys on SGBV and harmful social norms; and (5) developing technical support plans with and for identified local actors.</description>

    <title>Identifying Opportunities for Gender-Sensitive Stabilisation and Governance</title>
    <description>This project works to build an evidence-based analysis of public perception changes on gender roles in Iraq, in order to provide programming and policy recommendations that aim to inform public policy and contribute to gender-sensitive stabilization and development. Project activities include: (1) creating a research design in collaboration with a reputable public opinion research firm; and (2) conducting 12 focus groups with demographically diverse community members in six Iraqi provinces (Anbar, Baghdad, Kirkuk, Kurdistan, Ninewa, and Salahaddin). The focus groups aim to explore citizens’ visions for the future, and what governance structures they believe may mitigate security threats, provide services, improve access to justice and consolidate social cohesion.</description>

    <title>Support to Elections in Sierra Leone</title>
    <description>This project supports two multi-donor funds administered by the UNDP in Sierra Leone: 1) the Conflict Prevention and Mitigation (CPM) fund; and 2) the Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund. Both funds seek to expand levels of electoral and democratic awareness and participation of women and girls, and prevent sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). On March 7, 2018, Sierra Leone is conducting local, legislative and presidential elections. These are the fourth elections since its decade-long civil war ended and the first conducted without the presence of a UN Observer Mission.  The CPM fund is intended to contribute to a peaceful and secure environment during the 2018 election processes through preventive and mitigation activities, including enhanced national dialogue, peace advocacy, and peaceful response capacities, as well as sustained public security, civil protection, human rights promotion, and peaceful response capacities.  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) of Sierra Leone successfully managed the administration of peaceful elections in 2007 and 2012, with declining levels of international involvement in the management of each election. While Sierra Leone has made progress in strengthening the electoral process, NEC requires further support. The SNEC fund aims to complement Government of Sierra Leone resources with technical and material support to the NEC to further their work on meeting their responsibilities for key 2018 electoral processes.</description>

    <expectedResults>In partnership with other donors, Canada contributes to the following expected outcomes: 1) the Conflict Prevention and Mitigation fund: i) enhanced national dialogue, peace, advocacy, and violence prevention; and ii) sustained public security, civil protection, human rights promotion, and peaceful response capacities.  2) the Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund: 1) strengthened capacity to administer technically sound, credible, inclusive and sustainable elections; and 2) improved confidence and participation in the electoral process.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved by the UNDP through the support of the Government of Canada and other international donors in 2017-2018 includes:  The Conflict Prevention and Mitigation fund: 1) nationwide peace advocacy campaigns created awareness among the public on peaceful election processes, political tolerance and the need for citizens to participate in democratic elections; 2) during the run-up to the March 2018 elections, a peace pledge was signed by 18 presidential candidates committing them and their supporters to peaceful conduct of campaigns, elections and acceptance of results; 3) through supporting human rights work, the project helped justice institutions (such as courts and tribunals) address electoral disputes by fast-tracking and resolving over 405 cases through Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms.  The Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund: 1) the presidential, parliamentary and local government elections of 2018 were held in a timely and credible manner; 2) a peaceful transition from one legitimately elected government to another was achieved; 3) the NEC’s planning and management capacity was strengthened; and 4) the NEC conducted inclusive elections which were commended by electoral observation missions.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Farmers’ Knowledge - COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project supports activities aimed at responding to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This project helps small agricultural entrepreneurs (SEA), including women and young people, to sustainably increase and diversify their food production and the profitability of their farms. This project strengthens the capacities of SEAs to adopt sustainable, profitable agricultural practices, promoting diversification and increased production. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a decrease in the daily income (purchasing power) of consumers, lower prices in markets, and reduced cash flow for processors and producers. There are difficulties in obtaining seeds and other necessary inputs in agricultural value chains. This threatens the production of farmers. In addition, restaurant closings and reduced purchases in the various markets led to a reduce demand for fresh products, thus reducing the anticipated income of producers and suppliers. Women groups which transform agricultural products into food are thus caught between a difficulty of access to the raw products and the possibility of finding customers for their processed products.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected results of this project include: In Senegal: (1) support for smallholder farmers' organizations in the purchase of grouped goods and services for the benefit of producers; (2) provision of funds for the purchase of end-of-season rice and groundnut stocks; (3) support for processing units of beneficiary women's groups on storage techniques, management in times of crisis, purchase of small equipment and supply of raw materials for processing; (4) redistribution of part of the processed products to organizations working with vulnerable populations (e.g. orphanages). In the Democratic Republic of the Congo: (5) support to food production by providing the scaling up of collective vegetable production plots already in place. These activities should reach 13,723 direct beneficiaries (including 6,175 women) and 41,169 indirect beneficiaries (including 21,778 women).</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>The results obtained up to June 2021 include: (1) 1,019 small agricultural entrepreneurs (including 454 women and 575 young people) received production support, including inputs and funding to scale up vegetable gardens; (2) 1,063 women received processing support, including access to raw products, management support, and purchase of processing equipment; (3) 2,629 vulnerable people (including 91 women, 147 young people and 132 12-year-old children) received part of the processed production free of charge.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Agriculture intelligente face au climat et sensible au genre au Nicaragua</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the resilience of women, men, girls and boys to climate change-related food insecurity, especially addressing its gendered impacts. It seeks to: (1) increase the practice of gender-responsive climate-smart agriculture, thus increasing peoples’ access to diverse foods; and (2) increase women’s participation in decision-making at the local level. The project supports vulnerable women-headed households who are reliant on subsistence farming.  Project activities include: (1) promoting gender-responsive climate-smart agriculture technologies, the use of drought-resistant varieties of beans and maize, community seed banks, and community garden planting to help increase women’s incomes; (2) providing training on entrepreneurship and financial management, market links, gender equality, women’s rights and leadership to women’s groups; and (3) conducting gender sensitization sessions for women and men leaders, youth, and male family members to increase community support for women to participate in decision-making.  The project aims to directly impact 3,345 direct beneficiaries (of which 1,750 women and girls) and 6,500 indirect beneficiaries for a total of nearly 10,000 people reached.  The project is implemented by Casa-Pueblito with partners including Gloria Quintanilla Women’s Cooperative, UCA Tierra y Agua, Community of Jiñocua, and Hogar Luceros del Amanecer.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis – Emergency Protection in Lebanon – IRC 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Lebanon is facing multiple compounding crises in 2021, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic decline and political fragility, the impact of the August 2020 Beirut Port explosions, and the ongoing refugee crisis. With the Syria crisis in its tenth year, Lebanon continues to host over an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide. As the protection environment continues to devolve and needs outpace available international assistance, over 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon live below the poverty line.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection services to refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (3) training women community leadership groups; and (4) conduction engagement sessions with men and boys on SGBV and harmful social norms.</description>

    <title>Strengthening an LGBTI-Inclusive Movement at the International Level</title>
    <description>This project supports OutRight International’s coronavirus (COVID-19) Global LGBTI Emergency Fund, which provides financial and other types of practical support to local partners worldwide. The Fund works to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic, by helping local partners create tailored responses to this crisis based on the needs of the people they serve. This project also supports OutRight's global research and advocacy programs that aim to collect data, develop analysis on the threats and opportunities confronting LGBTIQ communities worldwide, and uphold their human rights at national and international levels.  Project activities include: (1) providing financial resources or re-granting to in-country partners through COVID-19 Emergency Fund; (2) collecting and analyzing data to document and publish three reports including policy recommendations to be used as advocacy tools; (3) conducting capacity building sessions with LGBTI human rights defenders on leading and coordinating advocacy campaigns/meetings; and (4) on-going awareness raising on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics issues and technical support to duty-bearers at the international level in various United Nations spaces.  The main beneficiaries of this project are LGBTI people, communities and human rights defenders in developing countries.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased awareness of UNSCRs on North Korea by compliance officers in governments and in the private sector; (2) improved access by experts to resources to prevent North Korean proliferation-related activities; (3) stronger connections between private sector compliance officers and the subject matter experts producing information on North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction program; (4) strengthened capacity of professional associations to provide training and resources to prevent North Korean sanctions evasion; (5) strengthened national legal regimes for UNSCR sanctions enforcement; and (6) increased knowledge about managing sanctions-related risk at financial institutions.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2019) include: (1) organized a United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) training workshop in Djibouti in March 2019. This event engaged 24 participants from nine African countries and deployed a French-language UNSCR sanctions implementation handbook; (2) engaged subject matter experts from James Martin Center, Kharon, and the Royal United Services Institute. This is to promote open source information on North Korean sanctions evasion at six international conferences with over 1000 participants; (3) engaged over 30 legal experts from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago in regional and national meetings. This is to strengthen legal and regulatory regimes to implement UNSCRs on North Korea's proliferation; (4)  trainined over 38 shipping registry experts in four states in Latin America; and (5) engaged over 65 compliance officers and senior managers from banks and financial institutions in China. These participants engaged in webinars and in-person training to assess their exposure to financial penalties related to sanctions on North Korea. They also created a comprehensive sanctions resources website and shared best practices on sanctions risk management.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Jordan – Assistance to Refugees - OCHA CBPF - 2020</title>
    <description>June 2020 - As the conflict in Syria continues to place millions of people in dire humanitarian need, Jordan hosts up to 1.3 million Syrians in camps and host communities, of whom over 650,000 are registered. Additional populations of concern include 58,000 Iraqis and a small number of unregistered refugees, such as those from Yemen. Canada is working with experienced humanitarian partners to meet the emergency needs of the crisis-affected. This funding enables the provision of essential protection, health, food, and basic needs support to vulnerable people, focusing on women, girls and youth.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages the Jordan Humanitarian Fund, which is a country-based pooled fund (CBPF) that allocates resources to national and international humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of crisis-affected populations throughout Jordan. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving and life-sustaining activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance per  humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination and leadership primarily through the Humanitarian Coordinator function, and by leveraging the humanitarian cluster system; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with national and international partners.</description>

    <title>Mine Action Review</title>
    <description>This project aims to assist the national authorities of affected States Parties to take measurable actions to meet their commitments as laid out in the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC) and the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). This is accomplished through research, publications and recommendations from expert organizations to enhance information sharing among stakeholders. The project supports the organization and analysis of data on explosive remnants of war contamination worldwide, including national survey and clearance activities. This is done by publishing a series of annual reports with information on country-specific monitoring and country-specific analyses of progress. Project activities include: researching, drafting and publishing the annual reports: "Clearing the Mines," "Clearing Cluster Munition Remnants," "Guide to the Oslo Action Plan and Monitoring on Survey and Clearance," and, upon adoption of the related action plan, "Guide to the Lausanne Action Plan and Monitoring on Survey and Clearance."</description>

    <title>Support for the Implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty</title>
    <description>This project aims to support the prevention and eradication of illicit arms transfers, which fuel conflict and armed violence and undermine international peace and security, human rights and humanitarian law. Specifically, this project strengthens the efforts of stakeholders to effectively implement and universalize the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). This is accomplished by building a community of practice to better apply international standards governing the international trade in conventional arms and support and monitor the implementation of the Treaty. Project activities include: (1) providing insight and support to the Presidency of the ATT Conference of States Parties; (2) developing a methodology to identify and monitor progress on the Gender and Gender-Based Violence Action Plan (adopted at the 5th Conference of States Parties in 2019); (3) developing a policy paper on practical guidelines concerning violence against children, as related to Article 7.4 of the ATT which requires States Parties take into account the risk of conventional arms transfers “being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children”; and (4) launching the 2022 annual report of the Arms Trade Treaty Monitor at the 8th Conference of States Parties and  the United Nations General Assembly First Committee.</description>

    <title>Typhoon Rai - Emergency Response - IOM 2021</title>
    <description>December 2021 – Super Typhoon Rai, locally known as Odette, made landfall in the southern Philippines on December 16, bringing torrential rains, violent winds and storm surges. Reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. It is estimated that 2.4 million people are in need as a result of the impacts of the typhoon overall, including more than 144,000 displaced people. Over 1.7 million homes have been damaged by the storm and 10.2 million hectares of agricultural land have been affected.  With GAC’s support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the typhoon. Project activities include: (1) provision of emergency shelter materials such as shelter kits, tarpaulins and essential household items; (2) provision of complementary technical assistance to support safe housing repair; and (3) allocation of conditional cash and voucher assistance to displaced families.</description>

    <title>Typhoon Rai - Emergency Response - IFRC 2021</title>
    <description>December 2021 – Super Typhoon Rai, locally known as Odette, made landfall in the southern Philippines on December 16, bringing torrential rains, violent winds and storm surges. Initial reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. Although needs assessments are ongoing, it is estimated that 3 million people have been affected by the impacts of the typhoon overall, including more than 630,000 displaced people. Over 117,000 homes have been damaged by the storm and the Philippines’ Department of Agriculture reports that total crop loss is in excess of 19,000 metric tons.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the typhoon. Project activities include: (1) scaling up emergency health services, such as medical care and mental health and psychosocial support; (2) providing integrated assistance through multi-purpose cash, livelihood and shelter support; and (3) ensuring the protection of vulnerable people, including through gender and inclusion programming.</description>

    <title>Strengthening the Humanitarian Response of Canadian NGOs – CCIC</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen the quality and effectiveness of humanitarian action by Canadian non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The project supports the Humanitarian Response Network (HRN), a forum for Canadian humanitarian non-governmental organizations to share information, coordinate humanitarian responses, and build organizational knowledge and skills.  Project activities include: (1) information sharing and coordinating activities in response to major humanitarian crises, as well as on best practices and lessons learned; (2) training workshops for HRN members and other humanitarian stakeholders; (3) conducting speaker series that brings experts, both academics and practitioners from Canada and abroad, to speak on key humanitarian topics; and (4) developing a short public engagement strategy, to define key opportunities and approaches to the public engagement component of the HRN’s work.  The activities of the Humanitarian Response Network are of benefit to members of the Canadian humanitarian community including researchers, practitioners and policy makers.</description>

    <title>Renforcement des services et des systèmes de réponse à la violence basée sur le genre à Cabo Delgado</title>
    <description>This project increases support for women and girls’ rights and protection from gender-based violence (GBV) in selected districts of Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique. It does this by strengthening the GBV response from multiple sectors and enhancing community systems that support women and girls’ rights,  including through preventing GBV and other harmful practices. Project activities include: (1) training and monitoring teams from multiple sectors (for example, healthcare workers and school gender focal points/contacts) at provincial and district levels on GBV case management; (2) supporting the Cabo Delgado GBV development partner coordination group in their humanitarian and development interventions; (3) creating safe spaces for women and girls that provide mentoring and life-skills lessons, vocational training and start-up kits for income generation in four target districts; and (4) supporting women’s associations and organizations of persons with disabilities to improve their GBV case management capacity. The project focuses on reaching vulnerable groups with GBV services and referrals. These vulnerable groups include women and girls and people living with disabilities and albinism.</description>

    <title>Responding to COVID-19 in Guatemala using Digital Health</title>
    <description>This project aims to decrease COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity in Guatemala, especially within Indigenous populations in the target regions of Alta Verapaz, El Quiche, Huehuetenango and Sololá. The project intends to strengthen the capacity of 3,500 health personnel to use digital systems to maintain quality and intercultural health services, particularly for women, girls and those experiencing marginalization or vulnerability. Project activities include: (1) providing equipment to deliver distance education programs to priority Ministry of Health training sites; (2) providing training to health personnel and authorities to deliver COVID-19 distance education training; (3) providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Health to develop standardization practices and resources for culturally-sensitive teleconsultation in response to COVID-19; and (4) providing training to health personnel to use a nationally integrated digital system to collect and monitor COVID-19 data.  This initiative expects to improve health services for 3.7 million people in Alta Verapaz, El Quiche, Huehuetenango and Sololá in Guatemala. This includes 3.1 million Indigenous people (1.6 million women and girls).</description>

    <title>Building Inclusive Green Municipalities Covid related activities</title>
    <description>The project helps strengthen the effectiveness of South African municipalities in the Eastern Cape. It focuses on those with high poverty rates and a solid commitment to governance reform to stimulate local growth and job creation, implement climate change action measures, and deliver better and more inclusive public services. The amendment will leverage and augment the capacity of this project to enable a rapid, direct and efficient response.  The $400,000 funding increase responds to the South African government's emergency appeal, as articulated in May with the United Nations, and will not change the project's scope. It allowed for immediate support to COVID-19 response activities of the six partner municipalities. An increase in the project ensures a timely gender-sensitive response, given FCM's established networks, relationships and systems already in place. Specifically, this increase will support women entrepreneurs in recovering from the economic impact of COVID-19. Also, it will enhance community awareness on how to stay safe; provide IT support and technology to allow municipalities to conduct business virtually and communicate with their constituents; provide sanitizers, disinfectants and soap; and water tanks in water-constrained communities to help protect vulnerable populations.</description>

    <title>Sexual Reproductive Health and Gender-Based Violence response to COVID-19 – IRC – Yemen - 2021</title>
    <description>April 2021 – The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic defines global health crisis of modern times, with over 2,000,000 recorded deaths worldwide. In countries already experiencing humanitarian crises or with highly vulnerable populations, COVID-19 has placed even more pressure on essential services, infrastructure and systems. It has also resulted in adverse effects on women and girls’ provision and use of health and protection services.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) support to over 67,000 refugees and vulnerable people in Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing prompt and effective treatment to children for communicable and non-communicable diseases; (2) training and motivating health workers to provide curative consultations; (3) screening and treating children aged 0-59 months for malnutrition; (4) providing emergency obstetrics and neonatal care centres with medical equipment and personal protective equipment; (5) providing SRHR services and information to  women and girls, at community and facility levels; (6) providing clinical care for survivors of sexual assault, referrals for gender-based violence (GBV) case management and referrals for focused psychosocial support for survivors or those at risk of GBV; and (7) disseminating information through sessions on SRHR issues and the GBV response services available for targeted communities.</description>

    <title>Investigation and Response to Emerging Viral Pathogens in Laos</title>
    <description>This project aims to build sustainable local capacity in Laos to investigate and respond to emerging viral diseases that can be transmitted to humans from animals (zoonotic). The goal is to reduce the threat of potential deliberate use of these novel pathogens by building and fostering a scientific partnership between Canada and Laos. Project activities include: (1) development of a detailed work plan and collaborative framework for a joint Canada-Laos laboratory on emerging zoonotic viral pathogens; (2) delivery of training and mentoring on diagnostics and research of emerging viral pathogens to Lao scientists and technicians by Canadian subject matter experts; (3)  development of an inventory for bats, rodents and other mammals from, in and around bat caves in northern and central Laos, as well as wet markets; and (4) development of a database indicating zoonotic viral pathogens detected from biological samples of bats, rodents and other mammals.</description>

    <title>Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation- Institutional Support 2021-2022</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) side of the Joint Support Team of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC). The GPEDC uses these funds, along with other donors’ funding to achieve its mandate of improving the effectiveness of development cooperation, including through its inclusive global platform bringing together governments, civil society groups, the private sector, trade unions, parliamentarians, and others.  The 2020-2022 Programme of work of the GPEDC focuses on important reforms to ensure the organisation remains fit for purpose and effectively contributing to the realization of the SDGs along through the implementation of the four effectiveness principles adopted in Busan in 2011: Ownership by partner countries, a focus on results, inclusive partnerships, and transparency &amp; mutual accountability. Four foundational elements of effective partnerships will benefit from special attention during the reforms: (1) anchoring effectiveness efforts at country level; (2) strengthening constituency and engagement; (3) mainstreaming learning; and (4) enhancing and leveraging stakeholder-led political outreach and advocacy.</description>

    <expectedResults>The central objective of the GPEDC’s 2020-2022 Work Programme is to drive behaviour change towards more effective development cooperation, in support of the SDGs. The expected outcomes as stated by the GPEDC include: (1) improved development effectiveness to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; (2) strengthened partnerships; and (3) increased monitoring for action at the country level. The GPEDC’s nine Action Areas will further contribute to global policy development on thematic aspects of effective development cooperation.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved by the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) as of December 2022 include: (1) refined, strengthened, and approved the new GPEDC monitoring framework to support global transparency and accountability, and mutual learning on effective development cooperation through a flexible approach led by partner countries; (2) increased number of countries that strengthened or took action to strengthen policy and institutional arrangements that support integrated and inclusive approaches to planning, efficient management of diverse development cooperation flows, and enhanced coordination and partnerships; (3) concluded reforms on the structure of the GPEDC and provided a clear direction forward at the December 2022 High-Level meeting. Other important deliverables from member-led Action Areas include the Kampala Principles Assessment framework and toolkits, the South-South cooperation self-assessment framework, and a research paper on the effectiveness of the multilateral system. Throughout the Programme of work, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provided advisory, secretariat, and communication support to the Steering Committee and the Co-Chairs of the GPEDC.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Cheminformatics – A Chemical Weapons Non-Proliferation Compliance Tool</title>
    <description>This project supports the development of a user-friendly tool to identify controlled chemicals. This tool is intended to bolster the control of chemical warfare agents and their precursors. With the utilization of this tool, the project will increase the operational capacity of front-line officers to implement international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 1540. Project activities include: (1) developing a database of controlled chemicals and national legal measures based on national and international control lists of chemical warfare agents and precursors; (2) providing a roadmap for further prototype development and field-testing of the tool; and (3) forming an expert consultative group to assess the tool.</description>

    <title>Syria and Iraq Crises - Supporting the Safety of Humanitarian Workers</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The ongoing crises in Syria and Iraq continues to drive protracted displacement and humanitarian needs across the region. Over 10 years into the Syrian conflict, an estimated 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria, and 4.1 million persons in Iraq. In both countries, these needs have been met with large-scale humanitarian responses implemented by hundreds of implementing organizations working in high-risk environments. These humanitarian responses in Syria have also been marred by countless attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel.  With GAC’s support, this project works to support humanitarian organizations in fulfilling their mandates safely by providing timely information and assistance in mitigating risk. Project activities include: (1) providing daily reporting including incident reports, analytical reports and thematic reports; (2) facilitating coordination meetings on access, safety and security amongst humanitarian organizations; (3) providing expert advice on risk mitigation at all stages of clients’  program cycle; and (4) provision of capacity building and crisis response to humanitarian organizations, including reviews of partner security plans and policies, free training courses in security management and conflict analysis.</description>

    <title>Health and protection services for vulnerable people - Multi-Country - 2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 - More than 7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in the region, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict.  With GAC’s support, this project is helping to improve access to life-saving protection and health services to vulnerable people in Colombia and Venezuela. The project will provide gender-responsive protection and health services, including SRH, through the deployment of mobile teams. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care services, including SRH, through the deployment mobile health teams;( 2) providing comprehensive protection services, including GBV case management, psychosocial and legal support; and (3) raising awareness on GBV and SRH and protection and health services available.</description>

    <title>Democratic Republic of Congo - Emergency Appeals - World Health Organization 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and 2020 expects additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDPs) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the World Health Organization’s emergency operations aim to rapidly assess the threat of infectious disease outbreaks and initiate urgent activities to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by infectious disease outbreaks, and to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess outbreaks; (2) delivering essential medications, medical supplies and equipment; (3) providing training to health personnel; (4) coordinating and implementing vaccination campaigns; and (5) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Emergency Funding - Canadian Red Cross -  2020 Appeals</title>
    <description>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is one of the three pillars of the Red Cross movement. The IFRC coordinates and works with national societies around the world to provide humanitarian aid to people affected by natural or man-made disasters, mainly in non-conflict situations.  The proposed initiative will support several IFRC Appeals which aim to provide urgent and life-saving assistance to vulnerable people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh and South America. Project activities include: (1) supporting the provision of basic services to Venezuelans in countries affected by the crisis including first aid services, psychosocial support and the distribution of information materials to crisis-affected and in-transit people; (2) increasing access to protection, health care and material relief assistance to refugees and host communities in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh; and (3) establishing and maintaining infection prevention and control measures in health facilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</description>

    <title>Hurricane Eta - Emergency Response - IFRC 2020</title>
    <description>November 2020 - Hurricane Eta made landfall in Central America on November 3 as a powerful Category 4 storm. The resulting rainfalls and persistent flooding has affected hundreds of thousands of people in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other surrounding countries. To date, rising river levels and landslides have caused over 100 deaths, led approximately 60,000 people to seek shelter, and destroyed important health and social infrastructure, including major hospitals. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is coordinating with National Societies in the region to help support emergency medical services and aid distribution, in areas most affected by the storm. .  With GAC’s support, National Societies are working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by Hurricane Eta. Project activities include: (1) providing essential household items and emergency shelter; (2) distributing safe water and hygiene kits; and (3) scaling up emergency medical services.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the healthcare system. Essential items, such as food and medicine, are out of reach for over 7 million people. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation has further declined due to border closures, weakened economic activity, and increasing demands on the health system already struggling. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations require critical live-saving assistance, including primary healthcare, water, sanitation services, hygiene kits, as well as food and nutrition assistance.  With GAC's support, this project helps address the essential protection and nutrition needs of up to 43,500 crisis-affected children, adolescents, and pregnant women in the region. Project activities include: (1) providing nutritional assistance and nutrition counselling session to crisis-affected people and healthcare providers; (2) providing training on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse to local organizations and communities; and (3) facilitating peer group counselling sessions to mitigate and respond to child and gender-based violence protection risks.</description>

    <title>Emergency Medical Response to Sexual and Reproductive Health in Columbia- Profamilia 2021-2023</title>
    <description>March 2021 - More than 5.4 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many now live in Colombia; however, others remain in transit to countries like Peru or Ecuador. In Colombia, the refugee and migrant crisis continues to drive significant humanitarian needs, as the country remains afflicted by violence and insecurity in some regions. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants have also been impacted significantly by the pandemic.  With GAC’s support, the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Profamilia work to improve access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and respond to sexual and gender-based violence in communities affected by the refugee and migrant crisis. Project activities include: (1) using Mobile Brigades to deliver comprehensive SRH services; (2) providing dignity kits to migrants with an emphasis on women and girls; and (3) delivering messages on gender-based violence and availability of support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Improving Access to Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 – Over 5.4 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Although many of these people are living in Colombia, others are transiting Colombia on their way to countries like Peru or Ecuador. The refugee and migrant crisis is still causing significant humanitarian needs in Colombia, where people also continue to experience the effects of violence and armed conflict that have long affected the area. In addition, the pandemic has significantly affected populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants.  With the support of GAC, Doctors of the World is helping to improve the health of over 35,000 people from Venezuela’s migrant groups, particularly women, youth and LGBTQ2I individuals, as well as people from the vulnerable host communities of Bogotá, Cali and Ipiales. Project activities include: (1) providing comprehensive pregnancy, childbirth and emergency neonatal care in mobile clinics and health centres to Venezuelan migrant women and adolescent girls and to the vulnerable host communities; (2) providing basic medical and psychological services to survivors, both women and men, of sexual and gender based violence; and (3) providing migrant groups and the host communities with awareness training on how to access the health system, training on sexual and reproductive rights and training on preventing sexual and gender based violence.</description>

    <title>Improving Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Protection Services in Ecuador - CARE</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Over 5.4 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently transiting through, or residing in, neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, border closures, pandemic stigmatization of migrants, and weakened economic activity have limited peoples’ ability to support their basic needs. An estimated 682,000 people in need in Ecuador require life-saving interventions, including primary healthcare, protection services, shelter, water, sanitation services, and hygiene kits, including food and nutrition assistance.  With GAC’s support, CARE helps address the essential sexual and reproductive health and protection needs of 6,180 crisis-affected people including migrants and refugees, and community members in the regions of Ibarra, Manta and Huaquillas in Ecuador. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health services, including information and support related to sexual and reproductive rights; (2) distributing hygiene and gender-based violence prevention kits; (3) providing multipurpose cash transfers to crisis-affected people; and (4) providing psychosocial and legal support to vulnerable migrants and refugees.</description>

    <title>P011223 – Emergency Afghanistan Support – OCHA – 2022</title>
    <description>December 2021 – Prior to the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. The recent escalation in conflict and the resulting upheaval in Afghanistan has worsened already significant humanitarian needs and further complicated an extremely challenging operational context. In 2022, an estimated 24 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  The United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) primary mandate is to oversee the coordination of international humanitarian responses, in partnership with national and international actors, facilitating the achievement of more coherent and effective humanitarian action.  With GAC’s support, OCHA is working to providing multi-sectoral assistance and protection to crisis-affected communities in Afghanistan. Project activities include: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting humanitarian needs assessment, prioritization and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funds for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - Development and Peace 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, close to 1 million Rohingya refugees live in 33 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar and almost 20,000 have been relocated to the island of Bhasan Char. Refugees continue to face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are highly reliant on international assistance to meet basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace and its local partner, Caritas Bangladesh, provide safe shelters and secure settlements to Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, using a community-based approach. Project activities include: (1) providing training on shelter construction, maintenance and upgrade to refugee households; (2) distributing construction materials and providing technical assistance; (3) facilitating community groups to develop site improvement action plans; and (4) undertaking site improvement works.</description>

    <title>Improving Access to Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 - More than 5.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in Colombia, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants, have also been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  With support from GAC, Doctors of the World is helping to improve the health status of more than 45,000 people in Venezuelan migrant populations, particularly women and adolescent girls, as well as vulnerable host communities in Bogotá, Cali, Ipiales and Soacha. Project activities include: (1) providing basic medical and psychological services to survivors amongvulnerable migrant populations; and (2) providing awareness training on access to health systems, sexual and reproductive rights and the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence among migrant populations and host communities.</description>

    <title>Madagascar - Emergency Response - Relief Supplies - CRCS - 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – Starting on January 17, 2022, torrential rains began to cause widespread flooding in the central Analamanga region of Madagascar. In rapid succession, the eastern region of the country was then struck by Tropical Storm Ana on January 23, Tropical Cyclone Batsirai on February 5 and Tropical Storm Domako on February 15. The Malagasy National Disaster Management Office has reported widespread devastation of livelihoods and damage to homes, schools, health facilities and other infrastructure. More than 136,000 people across the country have been affected by these disasters, with over 17,000 displaced and 61 deaths reported.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross Society (CRCS) dispatches emergency relief supplies to support the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in meeting the emergency shelter and water, sanitation and hygiene needs of impacted people in Madagascar.</description>

    <title>Sri Lanka Crisis – Emergency Response - WFP 2022</title>
    <description>November 2022 – Since March 2020, Sri Lanka has been facing a growing economic and financial crisis. This crisis intensified throughout the past year, leading to a shortage of essential food and non-food items, significant increases in commodity prices and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. The key humanitarian impacts include the loss of livelihoods, rising food insecurity, lack of drinking water, power cuts and shortages of life-saving medicines, among other issues. The United Nations estimates that 7 million people across all 25 districts of Sri Lanka require humanitarian assistance as a result of this multi-dimensional crisis.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) delivering non-perishable nutritious foods to people in need; (2) providing emergency cash-for-work assistance in semi-urban and rural areas; (3) making multi-purpose cash transfers to cover immediate food needs and support livelihoods; and (4) facilitating transport and emergency logistics response equipment.</description>

    <title>Improving Access to Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 - More than 7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in Colombia, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants, have also been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  With support from GAC, Doctors of the World is helping to improve the health status of crisis-affected people, particularly women and adolescent girls, in Valle del Cauca, Nariño, and the Ipiales – Cali – Pereira migration route. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, SRH services, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to vulnerable refugee and migrant populations as well as host communities; and (2) providing training to improve quality of the above mentioned services to crisis-affected populations.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies – World Health Organization - 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 – The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks and conflicts. The WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial acute response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  With GAC’s support, the CFE helps the WHO react early to prevent escalation of health emergencies. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; and (4) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Türkiye - Emergency Response - Relief Supplies - CRCS - 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 – On February 6, 2023, a strong earthquake of 7.8 magnitude occurred in southern Türkiye, in the province of Gaziantep, close to the border with northern Syria. Successive aftershocks and a second powerful earthquake resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. The extensive damage to homes and critical infrastructure is exacerbating existing issues across the region with cold temperatures making things even worse for those affected.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross is dispatching 22,000 units of essential supplies to support the emergency response to the Türkiye earthquakes. These items include blankets, shelter toolkits, hygiene parcels, and kitchen sets.</description>

    <title>Haiti - Emergency Shelter and Livelihood Intervention - CECI 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 - Haiti remains affected by a convergence of humanitarian crises, including the residual effects of Hurricane Matthew and El Niño-related droughts. Around 2.8 million people require humanitarian aid in 2018. This includes 1.3 million food-insecure people and 1 million people in areas affected by Hurricane Matthew still requiring emergency assistance. Cholera also remains a major threat for hundreds of thousands of families.  With GAC's support, the Centre d'étude et de coopération internationale (CECI) is supporting the repair of damaged homes and helping to restore livelihoods benefiting up to 34,000 people affected by Hurricane Matthew in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud. Project activities include: (1) supporting the repair of up to 400 damaged homes; (2) distributing small livestock and agricultural incentive packages to vulnerable individuals, including young women herders; and (3) providing small cash grants to up to 300 vulnerable women who lost their economic activities in the aftermath of the hurricane and have still not been able to rebuild their businesses.</description>

    <title>Achieving Reproductive Rights for Adolescents, Reducing Maternal and Newborn Mortality</title>
    <description>The goal of this project is to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of adolescent girls and women, and to reduce maternal and newborn mortality among vulnerable populations in Bolivia. This is to be achieved through a rights-based approach that is adolescent-friendly and culturally-sensitive. The project addresses barriers to adolescents’ demand for reproductive and sexual health services, challenges in the provision of such services and community and institutional level governance and accountability. Plan Canada works with CIES (Bolivian NGO) to implement the project in 12 municipalities in the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potosí.  COVID response: As a result of the pandemic-related restrictions, the project adapted many of its activities to remote implementation, allowing work to continue without altering the expected project results and also responding to the new challenges the pandemic places on the exercise of SRHR and gender equality. Most of these activities seek to protect and maximize project outcomes by taking into account additional challenges faced by health and protection authorities in offering services to youth and adolescents in the context of the pandemic.</description>

    <title>Colombia - Emergency Health Intervention - Doctors Without Borders Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – In late 2016, a peace agreement was signed between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), ending over fifty years of conflict, which had a significant impact on the country and displaced over 7 million people. Nonetheless, populations continue to suffer the consequences of conflict and other situations of violence by other armed groups, such as displacement, sexual violence and restricted access to basic services. An estimated 4.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 as a result of violence, conflict and natural disasters. Main humanitarian needs include access to health care services in rural areas, protection services as well as safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene systems.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders Canada is increasing access to basic health care and mental health care in the departments of Nariño and Valle del Cauca. Project activities include: (1) providing comprehensive medical care to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV); (2) providing mental health care for victims of violence and those suffering from severe mental illness; (3) training health workers and community leaders on mental health and psychological first aid and SGBV; and (4) increasing awareness on mental health and SGBV within vulnerable communities and relevant organizations/institutions.</description>

    <title>Colombia - Improving Hygiene, Nutrition and Access to Safe Water - Action Against Hunger 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Despite the recent signature of a historic a peace agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia continues to face conflict and violence. In addition to the vulnerable populations affected by mobility restrictions and constraints to access assistance and basic services, Colombia is increasingly a destination or transit country for Colombians returning from Venezuela, Venezuelans and/or indigenous populations residing in the border areas. As a result of the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, the arrival of thousands of Venezuelans with limited means is increasing the pressure of basic services in host communities.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger is helping address the basic water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition and protection needs of up to 10,050 crisis-affected people in the departments of La Guajira and Nariño. Project activities include: (1) distributing up to 1,200 family water kits; (2) distributing up to 850 hygiene kits or vouchers for hygiene kits; (3) providing health and nutritional assistance to pregnant and lactating women and children under five; (4) constructing or rehabilitating basic water and sanitation collective systems in schools/communities; (5) providing emergency cash-based transfers to vulnerable households, including displaced; and (6) training on basic hygiene practices and hygiene promotion for up to 2,000 crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>Assistance in Health, Shelter and Protection in Colombia - RET International 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, RET International is helping address the basic health, shelter and protection needs of up to 9,400 crisis-affected and displaced people in the region of Catatumbo in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing supplies and materials to improve access to emergency shelters for displaced women and girls; (2) distributing up to 200 dignity kits; (3) providing legal, medical, psychosocial and protection services to survivors or persons at-risk of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV); (4) providing cash-based vouchers to up to 800 vulnerable and displaced people; and (5) providing technical assistance to support the official registration of internally displaced people.</description>

    <title>Water, Hygiene and Sanitation, and Shelter Assistance in Ecuador - CARE 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Ecuador is both a transit and destination country for refugees and migrants from Venezuela, with an estimated 500,000 people in need of assistance. Many are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, CARE is helping address the basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter and protection needs of up to 11,000 crisis-affected people in Tulcan, Ibarra, Quito and Huaquillas in Ecuador. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating up to two temporary shelters; (2) establishing temporary safe spaces for women and girls; (3) providing multipurpose cash transfers to up to 5,000 households and people in transit; and (4) distributing hygiene kits to up to 3,500 people and 1,200 households (with children up to three years old).</description>

    <title>Nigeria - Nigeria Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - A decade of conflict between government forces and Islamist insurgents in northeastern Nigeria has given rise to one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world, characterized by mass displacement and grave human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. In 2020, assessments indicate that 7.7 million people are expected to require humanitarian assistance, including emergency food rations, treatment for life-threatening severe acute malnutrition and other healthcare services, and protection for vulnerable women and girls at grave risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian situation. Project activities include: (1) filling critical funding gaps to support life-saving activities, such as shelter, health or protection; (2) promoting needs-based assistance, including targeting the most vulnerable, in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Assistance in the North-West and South West Regions – Plan Canada 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - Conflict and instability has left Cameroon facing three distinct humanitarian situations: (i) internally displaced persons (IDPs) and Nigerian refugees residing in the conflict-affected Lake Chad basin; (ii) Central African refugees fleeing insecurity in Central African Republic (CAR); and (iii) conflict between Anglophone separatists and the Cameroonian government. With little prospect for the resolution of any of these situations, at least 4.4 million people in Cameroon are expected to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic survival and protection needs in 2020.  With GAC's support, Plan International Canada is addressing the urgent protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs of over 21,000 internally displaced people and other conflict-affected people in the North West and South West regions. Project activities include: (1) establishing community-based safe spaces and structures; (2) delivering comprehensive case management support services to vulnerable children, including child survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; (3) providing cash/voucher assistance to crisis-affected adolescents, youth and vulnerable households; (4) constructing gender-responsive community-latrines including handwashing stations in communities hosting IDPs; and (5) conducting hygiene promotion and sanitation awareness sessions for children, adolescents, households comprising IDPs, and host community members.</description>

    <title>Supporting Distance Learning in Response to COVID-19 in Sierra Leone and Liberia</title>
    <description>The project aims to support education for marginalized populations in Sierra Leone and Liberia in response to school closures and learning losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project’s innovative approach harnesses proven resources from traditional education programs with proven communication methods used in the agricultural sector through rural radio. The additional funding allows for new activities and for reaching a greater number of beneficiaries. Project activities include: (1) developing and distributing family literacy kits, including books and a parent’s lesson plan to households in the target regions; (2) providing up-to-date and evidence-based information about COVID-19 transmission prevention; (3) developing and transmitting radio programs including gender-responsive and learner-centred content for primary school students and their families; (4) introducing a ‘Reading Teacher’ in the form of recorded radio program for classrooms aligned with school curriculum; and (5) providing teacher training on Gender Responsive Pedagogy, active learning and lesson planning that support language learning.  The increased funding will enable the project to reach an additional 60,000 children (50% of whom are girls) and 2,158 teachers, for a total reach of 130,000 children (50% of whom are girls), approximately 350,000 members of their families (of whom 50% are women) and 4,258 teachers (2,989F; 1,269M).  The project expects to indirectly reach up to 637,837 Liberians (of whom 50% are women) and 687,989 Sierra Leoneans (of whom 50% are women) who live in the districts covered by the program and with access to the radio broadcasts.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased provision of gender-responsive  learning materials for primary school students and their families, including information about the COVID-19 crisis and preventative health measures; (2) increased interaction through radio between the education sector and community groups of parents and caregivers, that includes information about the COVID-19 crisis and preventative health measures; and (3) improved attitudes expressed towards gender equality and girls’ empowerment by girls, boys and their families.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of July 2022 include: (1) 202,000 students reached through an innovative combination of family learning materials and interactive radio programming, aired by 10 radio stations in Liberia and Sierra Leone (63,468 households or 946,383 people reached overall); (2) 2,158 teachers trained who worked with 59,797 students in grades three to six in 400 schools; and (3) 1,200 solar and manual chargeable MP3 players with radio functionality provided and 60,000 supplementary reading materials designed to teach teachers and students about COVID-19, public health and gender to 400 schools. As a result of the outcomes achieved, the participating students fared better in their reading assessments than national “reading and grade level” average scores.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Supporting the Government of South Africa’s response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the delivery of public services to improve the lives of South Africans—particularly those from marginalized groups and those living in remote areas. The project seeks to strengthen public administration in South Africa by providing technical assistance and support to various government departments. The project supports the Technical Assistance Unit within South Africa's National Treasury to enhance the ability of government departments to develop policies, and deliver and manage programs and services to South Africans. It also supports the South African Government's efforts to improve accountability and transparency by improving performance monitoring and evaluation government-wide.  The $400,000 funding increase supports the effective coordination of the Government of South Africa’s response to COVID-19.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project includes: (1) increased equitable access to safe, secure, quality, and inclusive education and learning for girls, adolescent girls, including those with disabilities, and boys in crisis and conflict situations, fragile and humanitarian settings. Students in targeted schools will be sensitized on hygiene and coronavirus prevention (COVID-19); and (2) improved food security and nutrition for school-age girls, including those with disabilities and boys in targeted areas.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (January 2022) to promote good hygiene and prevent the spread of COVID-19 include: (1) distributed more than 1,500 handwashing kits and 200 medical screening kits to enable students to adhere to protective behaviours, resulting in no reported cases of COVID-19 in the targeted schools; (2) organized awareness campaigns for students, teaching staff, canteen workers and the educational community to address the pandemic in all beneficiary schools. These informed actors helped in the fight against the spread of COVID and increased the reach of the measures taken; and (3) provided material support to the Ministry of National Education, literacy and promotion of national languages, including computers and a vehicle to strengthen monitoring and reporting, on school feeding activities.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Coordination of humanitarian interventions by the Regionally-Hosted Pooled Fund for West Africa-OCHA</title>
    <description>The deepening humanitarian and protection crisis in West and Central Africa is putting millions at risk. In Burkina Faso, northern Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger, and northeast Nigeria alone, a new record high of 29 million Sahelians require humanitarian assistance and protection. This includes 3.8 million people in Niger, an increase of over 3.1 million in 2020. In addition to persistent food insecurity, malnutrition and other humanitarian needs, Niger is also affected by security and protection concerns. This is particularly the case in the region of Diffa, which is impacted by the Lake Chad Basin Crisis, and in the western regions of the country bordering Mali and Burkina Faso. As of February 2021, these regions were hosting more than 229,734 refugees from Mali and Nigeria and 298,458 people who have been internally displaced in Niger. Specific challenges faced by women and girls include a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services and increasing risks of sexual and gender-based violence. To respond to these humanitarian needs, this grant represents Canada’s support to the Regionally-Hosted Pooled Fund in West Africa, managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  Project activities include: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting strategic planning, humanitarian needs assessment and humanitarian needs prioritization; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>2020 – INSO - Supporting the safety and security of humanitarian non-governmental organizations</title>
    <description>April 2020 – The changing nature of conflicts worldwide has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian needs, and poses unique safety and security challenges for humanitarian organisations delivering assistance to vulnerable populations, despite protections enshrined in international humanitarian law. Conflicts worldwide are resulting in countless and often deliberate attacks on medical and humanitarian personnel. More than ever before, frontline humanitarian workers and non-governmental organizations require free and up to date information, analysis and advice that supports informed decision making and enables humanitarian access, helping them serve populations most in need.  With GAC’s support, INSO works to support humanitarian organizations in fulfilling their mandates safely by providing timely information and assistance in mitigating security risks. Project activities include: (1) providing daily reporting including incident reports, analytical reports and thematic reports; (2) facilitating coordination meetings on access, safety and security amongst humanitarian organizations; (3) providing expert advice on risk mitigation at all stages of clients’  program cycle; and (4) provision of capacity building and crisis response to humanitarian organizations, including reviews of partner security plans and policies, free training courses in security management and conflict analysis.</description>

    <title>Equitable Access to Inclusive Education in Crisis-Affected Regions of Cameroon</title>
    <description>The project seeks to improve schooling for children and adolescents aged 4 to 15 years, including those living with a disability, with a special focus on girls. The project targets areas affected by humanitarian crises in Cameroon’s Far North, Littoral and West regions. Project activities are aimed at those whose access to education has been severely limited by a crisis, particularly children and adolescents who have been displaced and repatriated, and those who have become refugees. Project activities include: (1) training 101 education and child protection workers on gender equality, on the rights of girls and on the rights of children living with a disability; (2) training education stakeholders on how to integrate out-of-school children into education systems, particularly girls and children living with a disability; (3) developing and implementing gender- and inclusion-sensitive school improvement plans, including the construction of latrines adapted to the specific needs of adolescent girls and children with a physical disability; and (4) training 1,344 teachers on themes related to education in emergencies, gender-based violence in schools, special education and gender-sensitive teaching practices.  The project seeks to increase the enrolment rate of girls in the targeted areas, directly affecting 77,200 girls and 2,100 children living with a disability. Boys also benefit from access to quality education.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2021) include: (1) trained 863 child protection and education actors (265 women and 597 men) on inclusive education, child’s right, gender and human rights, and protection of children with disabilities; (2) trained 363 members of 20 community-based child protection networks (164 women and 199 men) on child’s right to education. Also strengthened their ability to identify and refer vulnerable out-of-school children to animators and social workers; (3) promoted and valued their efforts to sensitize parents to the importance of keeping children in school. As well, their prevention and protection actions already benefited 8,054 people, including 2,903 children (1,306 boys and 1,597 girls) and 5,151 parents (2,973 women and 2,178 men); (4) identified 420 children (195 girls and 225 boys) at risk of dropping out of school and provided them with psychosocial, medical and legal support as needed; (5) supported school reintegration (school fees and supplies for their return or stay in school). Among those children, 33 (20 girls and 13 boys) are children living with disability; (6) provided school supplies (books, pen, pencil, school bag) to 400 pupils (171 girls and 229 boys). Among these,135 children living with a disability (50 girls and 85 boys) enrolled in 25 different primary schools; (7) identified 420 children (195 girls and 225 boys) as being at risk of dropping out of school received psychosocial, medical, legal support as needed, or support for school reintegration (school fees and school supplies for their return/stay in school); (8) provided hygiene and dignity kits (including a torch and a whistle  to prevent rape and attract attention if attacked) to girls in all zones; and (9) distributed 7,936 temporary hand-washing stations, 711,000 bars of soap and 31,332 hydro-gel hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Multistakeholder Crisis Response Network for Ukraine</title>
    <description>This initiative develops, administers and tests the efficacy of a Multistakeholder Crisis Response Network to help achieve strengthened connectivity and interaction among the multistakeholder community - social media platforms, civil society organizations, and G7 member and observer governments - dedicated to countering conflict-related disinformation in and around Ukraine. Project activities include: (1) mapping key stakeholders’ respective capabilities, functions, needs, and points of contact to identify gaps in the overall response and lay the groundwork for coordination; (2) identifying and operationalizing a secure shared communications channel to intake and match requests for support with available resources and capabilities across the network; (3) convening ad hoc briefings in meetings with stakeholders; and (4) undertaking analysis and collecting lessons learned during the response to the Ukrainian crisis. It does so to develop a post-conflict playbook for future crises threatening other at-risk democracies.</description>

    <title>Sri Lanka – Humanitarian Crisis - IFRC 2022</title>
    <description>June 2022 – Since March 2020, Sri Lanka has been facing a growing economic and financial crisis. This crisis intensified throughout 2021, leading to a shortage of essential food and non-food items, significant increases in commodity prices and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. The key humanitarian impacts include the loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, lack of drinking water, power cuts and shortages of life-saving medicines, among other issues. The United Nations estimates that 5.7 million people across 25 districts of Sri Lanka require humanitarian assistance as a result of this multi-dimensional crisis.  With GAC’s support, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) works to meet the immediate food, health, protection and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs of the most vulnerable populations in Sri Lanka, through an integrated and multi-sectoral response. Project activities include: (1) distributing nutritional dry rations, school packs and menstrual hygiene products to vulnerable households; (2) delivering mental health, psychosocial support and first aid support; (3) providing safe drinking water; and (4) training volunteers on preventing and addressing sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Pakistan Floods - Emergency Response – Action Against Hunger 2022</title>
    <description>September 2022 – Heavy monsoon rainfall has affected Pakistan since mid-June. The rainfall is causing widespread flooding that has affected 33 million people. Reports show that it has resulted in road closures, power outages and disruptions to communications in multiple regions. To date, over 1,300 people have died in the floods and nearly 13,000 injured. Government authorities and humanitarian agencies have identified priority humanitarian needs. The immediate needs are: food, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene services and healthcare. An estimated 6.4 million people require humanitarian aid because of the floods.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of flood-affected people. Project activities include: (1) constructing and rehabilitating water points; (2) distributing hygiene kits; (3) providing emergency healthcare, including sexual reproductive services; and (4) providing treatment for malnutrition.</description>

    <title>Supporting Elections for Ethiopia’s Democracy Strengthening (SEEDS)</title>
    <description>This project supports the conducting credible, inclusive and peaceful elections in Ethiopia in 2021. It is Canada’s contribution to the multi-laterally funded United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) electoral assistance project. The project supports the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) in the planning and delivery of the 2021 general elections. The project focuses on the belief that technically capable, independent, and trusted institutions make for the conduct of credible, inclusive and peaceful elections.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the NEBE as a cohesive institution through professional development, training, and supporting gender-sensitive reform and procedure drafting; (2) introducing and strengthening the NEBE’s various systems, procedures, standards, tools, and protocols; (3) building staff capacities related to electoral processes; (4) building NEBE capacities for transparent and timely communication with the electorate; and (5) building NEBE capacities for detecting and resolving election-related disputes. The project’s strategic approach is to support the NEBE in ensuring inclusive participation of all groups, including women, youth, and ethnic groups from all regions.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased participation by civil society, including women and human rights organizations, in developing gender-sensitive national policies and practices during and after the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) increased integration of gender equality and diversity considerations in COVID-19 recovery policies and programs by state institutions; and (3) supported the institution of greater protective measures that ensure fundamental freedoms and democratic processes during and after an emergency situation, particularly for marginalized communities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (February 2023) include: (1) awarded 10 capacity-building grants to civil society organizations in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Jamaica, Malawi, Nigeria, and South Africa; (2) the Commonwealth Foundation organized dedicated sessions for grantees on gender and its intersectionality, supported grantees’ policy and advocacy work, and offered each grantee tailored sessions enabling them to build effective monitoring and evaluation plans; and (3) helped marginalized communities to address barriers to inclusion and better advocate for their rights surrounding Covid-19. For instance, in Bangladesh, the Turning Point Foundation’s project worked to change national Covid-19 policies to better account for people with disabilities. This resulted in the registration of 2,000 people with disabilities, their parents, and caregivers for the Covid-19 vaccine and accessing government support.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Systematically integrating community voices into humanitarian response management</title>
    <description>The project supports Ground Truth Solutions to humanitarian actors in Burkina Faso in developing, implementing, and monitoring Humanitarian Response Plans that consider the views, priorities, and feedback of crisis-affected communities, including gender-specific perspectives. This project aims to address current gaps in accountability to affected populations by assessing and improving the efficacy and impact of humanitarian assistance. Project activities include: (1) gathering data through regular perception surveys from recipients of humanitarian assistance; (2) triangulating the data collected from crisis-affected populations with information from humanitarian partners. This would allow for a well-rounded analysis of the situation; (3) completing surveys of field workers and the local partners of international agencies. This would provide additional insight for humanitarian managers and donors; and (4) reporting the analyses and other findings to humanitarian partners and policymakers to influence and improve humanitarian response.</description>

    <title>Support to the 23rd International AIDS Conference and the 11th Scientific Conference</title>
    <description>This project supports the 23rd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2020) and the 11th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2021). The International AIDS Conference is the largest conference on any global health or development issue and brings together approximately 20,000 delegates every four years. The IAS Conference on HIV Science is the world’s most influential meeting on HIV research and brings together approximately 6,000 delegates every other year. The conference presents advances in basic, clinical and operational research to translate science into policy.  AIDS 2020 was to occur in Oakland and San Francisco, USA, from July 6-10, 2020. However, they switched to a virtual format due to COVID-19 health measures and travel restrictions. IAS 2021 was to take place on 18-21 July 2021 in Berlin, Germany; however, due to COVID-19 health measures and travel restrictions, this event also switched to virtual in collaboration with a local partner hub in Berlin.  As key platforms for engaging various stakeholders and beneficiaries at the intersection of science, advocacy and human rights, these conferences play an important convening role in enabling stakeholders to review progress and scientific evidence and to identify course corrections in science, policy and advocacy, to promote a human rights-based and gender-informed HIV response.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ABDJN - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Ivory Coast and Liberia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ACCRA - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Togo. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - DAKAR - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BEJING - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in China. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - CNBRA - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Fed. States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Rep. of Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.   The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - PRET - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - SSAL - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in El Salvador. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Uzazi Uzima II: Safe deliveries in Simiyu Region</title>
    <description>The Uzazi Uzima II project seeks to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity in all five districts of Simiyu region, Tanzania by improving the availability of quality adolescent, maternal and newborn health services in underserved districts through three mutually supportive mechanisms. The project will: improve the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers on maternal, newborn and sexual/reproductive health to ensure they can provide critical services to their beneficiaries in a gender sensitive and responsive way;  improve the infrastructure and supply-chain for health facilities to encourage women, girls and their families to use services; and improve gender responsive health management systems (such as planning, prioritization and management of services). The project will also increase awareness and understanding of sexual, reproductive, maternal and child health with special focus on men’s participation in reproductive, maternal and newborn health and decision making. Project activities include: (1) training health workers from four health centres and 24 dispensaries on: essential maternal and newborn health skills, such as Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC); Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), family planning; nutrition counselling; and newborn resuscitation; (2) refurbishing four health centres and 24 dispensaries to provide CEmONC, BEmONC, water, sanitation and hygiene and family planning services, including a satellite safe blood center at the regional hospital; (3) equipping targeted health facilities with the necessary stocks of equipment and commodities to provide BEmONC, CEmONC, family planning and safe blood services; (4) establishing a referral system for maternal and newborn health care and family planning services across all tiers of the health system; (5) training and supporting Ministry of Health and facility-based managers, and health workers to improve community to facility linkages (enhanced data collection, consolidation, analysis and reporting); and (6) training and equipping community health workers, traditional birth attendants, traditional healers, and local leaders to provide community-level health promotion services (including maternal and newborn health, water, sanitation and hygiene, family planning, nutrition, gender issues and use of mobile health technology to mobilize communities). The project is implemented in collaboration with Amref Health Africa in Tanzania, Marie Stopes Tanzania and Deloitte.</description>

    <title>Knowledge Sharing About Unpaid Care in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to redistributing unpaid care work for approximately 6 million people in 8 African countries. It does so by increasing recognition and information about unpaid care, and representing  the voice of unpaid care workers. The project seeks to increase the representation of unpaid care workers in public dialogues by building the capacity among broadcasters and producers of 15 radio stations to implement an on-air dialogue (OAD) approach. This approach features a short, carefully designed radio series to gather opinions via polling and interactivity tools shared with audiences to contribute to policy discussions. Global Affairs Canada seeks to develop these OADs in collaboration with Women’s Rights Organization. The project also aims to increase recognition by disseminating evidence and sharing media kits across the continent, and by engaging local women`s rights organizations with policymakers to further encourage advancing gender equality and women’s rights.  Project activities include: (1) conducting interactive radio approaches to promote an on-air exchange of knowledge about the value and inequity of gendered unpaid care work; (2) hosting public conversations that reflect women`s own experiences, perspectives on, and priorities regarding the value and inequity of gendered care work; and (3) creating scripts and other radio resources that are indefinitely accessible to 1,300 plus radio stations and over 3,000 individual broadcasting journalists to use in their future programs.</description>

    <title>Mobilizing the Media to fight the Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to combat the impact of COVID-19 on human rights, particularly those of women and girls. Project activities include: (1) providing training to journalists to report on the status of human rights and women’s rights as affected by COVID -19 (for example, access to health-care/social services, etc); (2) providing training to journalists to identify mis/disinformation on COVID-19, to debunk dangerous myths in social media; (3) providing training to journalists to only report scientifically valid information to the public; (4) educating targeted communities on how to both identify mis/disinformation in the media and to source sourcing credible information regarding COVID-19; and (5) and providing training to communities to recognize when their human rights are not being observed due to COVID-19.  This project is being implemented in Gambia, Ghana, Iraq, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, and Yemen.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BEJING - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in China. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BNGKK - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - CNBRA - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Fed. States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Rep. of Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - DELHI - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Bhutan, India and Nepal. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - KABUL - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Afghanistan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - YUNDE - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cameroon. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - HRARE - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Angola, Botswana et Zimbabwe. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>
