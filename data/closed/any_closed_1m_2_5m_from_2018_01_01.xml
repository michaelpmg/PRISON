    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance - Solidarités International 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 – Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) rapidly deteriorated. In 2017, the country continued to be plagued by violent conflict between armed groups and inter-communal violence.  The number of displaced people in the country has increased to over 1.24 million, comprised of roughly 688,000 internally displaced people and 556,375 refugees – the highest number ever recorded in CAR. In 2018, an estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance.  With GAC’s support, Solidarités International is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 10,100 conflict-affected people in Ouham and Nana-Gribizi prefectures, in the CAR. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as livelihoods support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 14 water points, benefitting up to 7,000 people; (2) raising awareness on hygiene practices of up to 7,000 people; (3) providing up to 120 vulnerable women with livelihood kits, benefitting up to 600 people; and (4) distributing food vouchers to 400 vulnerable households, benefitting up to 2,000 people.</description>

    <title>Alternatives - IYIP Internships 2018-2021</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Youth Internship Program (IYIP), funded by the Government of Canada's Youth Employment Strategy. The IYIP is designed to offer Canadian post-secondary graduates the opportunity to gain professional experience in international development.  In consortium with the Réseau des carrefours jeunesse-emploi du Québec, Université TÉLUQ, Ricochet and Funambules Médias, Alternatives sends 120 interns to 10 countries as part of the ICT Driving Social Change project. Project activities include: setting up a training program on how to use information and communication technology (ICT) as an international development tool for interns; developing and facilitating educational games in math, chemistry and physics; developing an online discussion forum every year to share best practices and tools; practical work with Canadian organizations working in the social communications, ICT, media or digital security sectors; and providing training on communications strategies in support of work on international development (governance, gender equality and environment).</description>

    <title>Canadian Bar Association - IYIP Internships 2018-2022</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Youth Internship Program (IYIP), funded by the Government of Canada's Youth Employment Strategy. The IYIP is designed to offer Canadian post-secondary graduates the opportunity to gain professional experience in international development.  As part of the Young Lawyers International Program, the Canadian Bar Association sends 128 interns to 10 countries. They acquire transferable employment skills, primarily through activities such as conducting legal research and analysis, writing, managing client relations, and liaising with justice sector stakeholders. The young interns also participate in public education and advocacy activities such as the promotion of human rights, either through policy advocacy for human rights and the rule of law, or the provision of legal services to local populations, including the most vulnerable.</description>

    <title>Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland - IYIP Internships 2018-2021</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Youth Internship Program (IYIP), funded by the Government of Canada's Youth Employment Strategy. The IYIP is designed to offer Canadian post-secondary graduates the opportunity to gain professional experience in international development.  The Fisheries and Marine Institute of the Memorial University of Newfoundland provides international internships to 100 interns in five countries. Through this program, youth interns apply their skills and knowledge to address international development issues such as environmental sustainability, adaptation to climate change and youth education, and improving outcomes for women and adolescent girls. Specific activities include: assessing the impact of community activities on climate change, promoting marine education and conservation, enhancing coastal community development and sustainable aquaculture, and creating/building partnerships with local governments and environmental groups.</description>

    <title>Canada World Youth - IAYI Internships 2018-2021</title>
    <description>This project is part of Global Affairs Canada’s International Aboriginal Youth Internships (IAYI) initiative. The internships focus on increasing the awareness, engagement, and participation of Indigenous youth in international development, while providing them with opportunities to expand their employment skills or further their education.  As part of the Pathways to Indigenous Youth Leadership project, Canada World Youth (CWY) sends 102 Indigenous youth to Colombia and Peru. For intern recruitment, CWY delivers the project in partnership with Canadian organizations with extensive national networks. Interns support local partners in the following areas: agricultural development; engagement of marginalized groups; recycling; reforestation; youth entrepreneurship; health; environmental education; and youth entrepreneurship.</description>

The Atlantic Council for International Cooperation (ACIC), in consortium with the Northern Council for Global Cooperation, the Mi'kmaw Conservation Group, BYTE - Empowering Youth Society and the Native Council of Prince Edward Island, sends 100 Indigenous youth interns to six different countries. The project supports the work of local partner organizations to improve the well-being of Indigenous peoples; secure the future of children and youth; improve maternal and newborn health; increase food security; advance democracy; and stimulate sustainable growth.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - Norwegian Refugee Council 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 – The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has deteriorated at an alarming rate since 2016.  A surge in violent conflict and inter-communal tensions erupted in previously peaceful areas and intensified in others in 2017, forcing millions to flee their homes; bringing the total number of internally displaced people in the country to 4.49 million and severely stretching the humanitarian community’s capacity to respond. Across the DRC, at least 13.1 million people require humanitarian assistance - an increase of 79% from the start of 2017. This includes 7.7 million severely food insecure people and close to 2 million severely malnourished children.  With GAC’s support, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 24,950 conflict-affected people in South Kivu, Tanganyika and Maniema provinces, DRC. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, non-food items, education, as well as livelihoods support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) providing up to 15,350 with tools or resources to improve livelihoods; (2) providing up to 15,350 with access to non-food items and/or hygiene kits; (3) rehabilitating up to 16 water points; and (4) providing up to 3,000 children with access to emergency education.</description>

Across the DRC, at least 13.1 million people require humanitarian assistance - an increase of 79% from the start of 2017.  This includes 7.7 million severely food insecure people and close to 2 million severely malnourished children.  With GAC’s support, Solidarites International is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 38,750 conflict-affected people in Kasaï Oriental, Lomami and Sankuru provinces, DRC. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, non-food items and livelihood support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) providing up to 5,000 households with tools and/or seeds to improve livelihoods; (2) providing up to 1,500 households with access to NFIs; (3) rehabilitate up to 5 water points and adding chlorination to up to 55 water points; and (4) providing hygiene sessions to up to 8,250  people.</description>

    <title>Ukraine - Emergency Protection, Shelter and Livelihoods - ACTED 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 - With the conflict in Eastern Ukraine entering its fourth year, there are currently approximately 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of ongoing hostilities. The protection environment is of particular concern due to the ongoing armed conflict, restrictions on freedom of movement and trade across the contact line, and the continued suspension of social benefits and pensions to thousands of people. An increase in the price of fuel, utilities and food, as well as limited access to health care has further heightened the vulnerability of conflict-affected people. An estimated 1.2 million people are currently food insecure as a result of the deteriorating socio-economic environment, 1.1 million people are at risk of interrupted water supply due to frequent shelling near critical water infrastructure, and increased heating costs and frequent service disruption are reducing vulnerable people’s ability to cope with Ukraine’s harsh winters.  With GAC’s support, the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) is providing emergency protection, shelter and livelihoods support to up to 11,330 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine. Project activities include: (1) providing multi-purpose cash assistance and food/hygiene vouchers; (2) providing emergency shelter support to households affected by frequent shelling; (3) providing psychosocial support and raising awareness of sexual and gender-based violence; and (4) providing agricultural inputs to help protect livelihoods.</description>

    <title>Nigeria - Livelihoods and Protection Assistance - Plan Canada 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 – The conflict between Boko Haram and Nigerian armed forces has devastated communities in north-eastern Nigeria. It is estimated that 10.2 million people will require humanitarian assistance in order to survive in 2018, of which 85% are women and children. As the conflict evolves, humanitarian access remains a challenge. Assistance for basic survival, basic services and protection is vital for displaced populations, host communities and vulnerable people across the north-east.  With GAC’s support, Plan Canada is helping to assist up to 23,000 conflict-affected people in Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing health education and distribution of dignity kits, which contains items required to help maintain feminine hygiene, dignity and respect in daily lives, to up to 3,500 women and girls of reproductive age; (2) establishing safe spaces for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and those at risk, benefitting up to 5,000 people; and (3) training and mentoring in income generating activities to up to 900 survivors of sexual and GBV and individuals at risk.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Common Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 – Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) rapidly deteriorated. In 2017, the country continued to be plagued by violent conflict between armed groups and inter-communal violence. The number of displaced people in the country has increased to over 1.24 million, comprised of roughly 688,000 internally displaced people and 556,375 refugees – the highest number ever recorded in CAR. In 2018, an estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance.  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as United Nations agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. The CHF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national NGOs, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Niger - Humanitarian Assistance in Diffa Region - Action Against Hunger 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 - Niger continues to face significant humanitarian challenges related to food insecurity, malnutrition, and forced displacement. The expansion of the conflict in Nigeria has led to more than 400,000 people in need and the highest levels of food insecurity in the country. It is expected that humanitarian needs remain high in Niger’s Diffa region throughout 2018.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger is addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of up to 28,650 people in the Diffa region. Project activities include: (1) providing reproductive health care services benefiting almost 4,000 women; (2) constructing family latrines, benefiting up to 1,400 people; (3) creating advocacy documentation on health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene; and (4) distributing gas kits for domestic use, to reduce cooking-related costs and therefore increase the purchasing power of households, benefiting up to 1,100 people.</description>

    <title>Chad - Humanitarian Assistance in Lac Region - International Rescue Committee 2018-2019</title>
    <description>March 2018 - Chad struggles with humanitarian emergencies related to food insecurity, malnutrition and displacement. As a result, 4.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Close to 900,000 people are faced with severe food shortages that threaten to wipe out their livelihoods. Severe acute malnutrition has surpassed the emergency threshold in fifteen of the country’s 23 regions. Conflicts and insecurity have uprooted hundreds of thousands of people internally and from neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, International Rescue Committee is addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of up to 15,274 people in the Lac Region. Project activities include: (1) providing quality services for holistic care to survivors of gender-based violence, benefiting up to 1,944 women and girls; (2) supporting the provision of care from health care personnel to survivors of sexual violence, benefiting up to 40 survivors; and (3) identifying and providing training to women’s groups on livelihoods activities, benefiting up to 300 people.</description>

    <title>Support to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 - Somalia’s relatively positive political trajectory has not led to significant improvements in the country’s humanitarian situation. Acute humanitarian needs remain high due to ongoing conflict and insecurity, displacement, poor basic services, food insecurity, malnutrition, and climatic variability. Al Shabaab remains a threat throughout south and central Somalia, leading to new displacement and concerns over humanitarian access in these areas. More than six million people, including more than one million internally displaced persons, require humanitarian assistance.  GAC’s support to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country. This funding will: (1) support life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promote needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthen coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improve the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia Drought – Nutrition, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Response – Action Against Hunger 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Ethiopia is facing a fourth consecutive year of drought affecting large areas in the south and east of the country. Recent assessments indicate that almost 8 million people require emergency food assistance and 3.85 million children face acute malnutrition. More than 6 million people are without access to safe drinking water. The effects of the drought have exacerbated ethnic conflicts along the border between the Oromia and Somali regions, displacing an estimated 1.5 million people over the past year.  With GAC support, Action Against Hunger is addressing the nutritional, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and health needs of an estimated 70,000 people in the badly drought-affected Oromia and Somali regions of Ethiopia. Project activities include: (1) treatment for acute malnutrition; (2) improvement of safe water points; and (3) educational outreach regarding sound hygiene and child care practices.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis – Save the Children 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 647,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already in the district of Cox's Bazar following earlier waves of displacement.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is helping to respond to the immediate needs of refugees in Cox’s Bazar, including the specific needs of women, girls and boys. Activities include: (1) improving access to sufficient water supply, gender-sensitive sanitation facilities and hygiene materials; (2) increasing access to emergency shelter and non-food items; (3) providing child friendly spaces with activities focusing on psychosocial support, protection and well-being of children; and (4) case management of children at risk of violence and other protection risks, including unaccompanied children or those separated from their families during the displacement to Bangladesh.</description>

    <description>January 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 647,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already in the district of Cox's Bazar following earlier waves of displacement.  With GAC’s support, Handicap International is helping to respond to the immediate needs of refugees in Cox’s Bazar, focusing on particularly vulnerable households with special needs. Activities include: (1) providing physical and functional rehabilitation for injured or disabled people, as well as mobility aids as needed; (2) providing mental health and psycho-social support for those affected by trauma; and (3) distributing infant, hygiene and dignity kits that take into account the specific needs of women and girls.</description>

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected and Displaced People - ADRA Canada 2018</title>
    <description>April 2018: The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is characterized by a complex combination of vulnerability to natural disasters, armed conflict, inter-communal tension, statelessness and displacement. It is estimated that 863,000 crisis-affected women, men, boys and girls will be in need of humanitarian assistance this year.  With GAC’s support, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA Canada) is increasing access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation services, and improving access to goods and basic services for conflict-affected and displaced populations in up to 52 camps in Kachin and Northern Shan states. Project activities include: (1) delivering gender sensitive hygiene promotion and hygiene kits; (2) improving water supply systems, desludging of existing facilities and providing gender-sensitive bathing cubicles and latrines; and (3) providing cash grants to internally displaced persons and particularly vulnerable people, such as pregnant and lactating women.</description>

    <title>Uganda - Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees - Plan International Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, more than 1.4 million, with roughly two thirds of them having arrived from South Sudan since July 2016. This large and rapid influx has strained the humanitarian response capacity in northern Uganda to near breaking. New refugee settlements almost immediately reach full capacity, while service providers struggle to meet the most basic needs of the community. Overall, South Sudanese make up more than three quarters of the refugee population in Uganda (more than 1 million people).  With GAC’s support, Plan International Canada is providing support for much-needed water, sanitation, hygiene, and protection for an estimated 34,000 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Arua and Yumbe districts of Uganda. Activities include: (1) the construction or rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities; and (2) the enhancement of protection services and psycho-social support for vulnerable children.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees - Doctors Without Borders  2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Ethiopia hosts the second largest number of refugees in Africa, nearly one million people. Approximatelyy 40% of these are from South Sudan and now live in the remote Gambella region of western Ethiopia. Although safe from the conflict and insecurity that forced them to flee, many refugees are still suffering from their effects, including acute malnutrition and trauma related to violence. With limited local options for self-sustainability and little chance of returning home in the near future, most refugee households remain reliant on ongoing international assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders Canada is providing support for much-needed healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health, for an estimated 800,000 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. Project activities include providing staff, training, equipment and supplies to the Gambella regional hospital.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Assistance for Drought-Affected Households - CARE Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Ethiopia is facing a fourth consecutive year of drought affecting large areas in the south and east of the country. Recent assessments indicate that almost 8 million people require emergency food assistance and 3.85 million children face acute malnutrition. More than 6 million people are without access to safe drinking water. The effects of the drought have exacerbated ethnic conflicts along the border between the Oromia and Somali regions, displacing an estimated 1.5 million people over the past year.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is providing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and livelihoods assistance to an estimated 36,000 displaced persons and host community members in the badly drought-affected Somali region of Ethiopia. Project activities include: (1) the rehabilitation and improvement of safe water sources; (2) the construction of communal latrines; and (3) providing cash-for-work opportunities.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - ADRA Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 671,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Many have arrived exhausted and traumatised and are now living in difficult conditions in camps and settlements. These new arrivals have joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already in the district of Cox’s Bazar following earlier waves of displacement.  With GAC’s support, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA Canada) is helping to respond to the immediate needs of refugees in Cox’s Bazar, with a particular focus on women with children under 5 years of age, girls, boys, the elderly and persons with special needs. Activities include: (1) providing gender-responsive shelter kits and tools; (2) providing dignity kits and essential household items such as blankets and mosquito nets; (3) promoting hygiene and health; and (4) providing child friendly spaces and safe spaces for women and girls.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance – Solidarités International 2018</title>
    <description>February 2018 - Following a coup d’état in March 2013, the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) deteriorated rapidly, as inter-communal violence spun out of control and led to thousands of deaths, massive human displacement, and grave human rights abuses. Elections in March 2016 saw the introduction of a new President in CAR that brought a welcome yet short lived calm to the country. However, CAR continues to be plagued by violence, armed criminality, and widespread humanitarian needs. Conflict between armed groups has persisted across much of CAR in 2017: armed groups have fragmented and reformed among various alliances, complicating the ongoing crisis. An estimated 2.5 million people in CAR will require humanitarian assistance in 2018. There has been a 50% spike in internal displacement, with internally displaced people now totalling over 688,000. The number of refugees has also increased to 556,375 bringing the total number of people displaced to over 1.24 million people—the highest number ever recorded in CAR. Attacks on and looting of humanitarian actors increased in 2017 and are hindering their ability to respond to needs relating to widespread food insecurity, high levels of child malnutrition, and protection of the most vulnerable populations, including women and girls.  With GAC’s support, Solidarites International is providing emergency assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 14,500 conflict-affected people in Ouham-Pendé and Ouham prefectures, CAR. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, non-food items, as well as livelihoods support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 12 latrine blocks, benefitting up to 3,000 people; (2) constructing or rehabilitating up to 6 shower blocks, benefitting up to 3,000 people; (3) raising the awareness of  up to 7,000 people of hygiene best practices; (4) providing up to 1,500 vulnerable women with hygiene kits; and (5) distributing food vouchers, benefitting up to 3,000 people.</description>

    <title>Pooled Fund in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - UNDP 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 - The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has deteriorated dramatically over the past year. The crisis has deepened and spread, affecting people in areas previously considered stable and stretching the coping mechanisms of people in areas already impacted. The surge in violent conflict and inter-communal tensions has forced millions of people to flee their homes in 2017, bringing the total number of internally displaced people in the DRC to 4.49 million. Insecurity has had a devastating impact on people’s ability to access food, and 7.7 million people across the DRC are facing severe food insecurity – a 30 per cent increase from the same time last year.  It is estimated that 13.1 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018. In October 2017, the United Nations (UN) activated a level 3 (L3) system-wide emergency response for the DRC due to a lack of donor support and ballooning critical needs. This deterioration, observed mainly in the Kasai, South and North Kivu and Tanganyika regions, is taking place against the backdrop of one of the world’s largest and most complex humanitarian crises.  GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the DRC Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. The Fund's main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national NGOs, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Pooled Fund - OCHA 2018</title>
    <description>April 2018: The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is characterized by a complex combination of vulnerability to natural disasters, armed conflict, inter-communal tension, statelessness and displacement. It is estimated that 863,000 crisis-affected women, men, boys and girls will be in need of humanitarian assistance this year.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian situation. Project activities include: (1) filling critical gaps to support life-saving activities, such as shelter, health or protection; (2) promoting needs-based assistance, including targeting the most vulnerable in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Emergency Appeals - World Health Organization 2018</title>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks (including Ebola) and conflicts. During health emergencies, WHO also leads and coordinates the international health response to contain disease outbreaks and provide effective relief and recovery to affected populations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, WHO’s emergency operations aim to rapidly assess the threat of infectious disease outbreaks and initiate urgent activities to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by infectious disease outbreaks, and to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; (4) coordinating and implementing vaccination campaigns; and (5) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Preparing for the Prosecution of Breaches of International Criminal and Humanitarian Law in Syria</title>
    <description>This project aims to support a sustainable future peace in Syria by enabling an accountability process which addresses crimes that have been committed throughout the conflict. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) is determined to achieve justice in the absence of an international court or tribunal with jurisdiction over Syria. CIJA employs its unique criminal investigative capacity to build a strong foundation for future transitional justice processes.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased consensus among diverse groups of influential Syrians on detailed measures to establish and manage a credible political process; (2) enhanced trust between representatives of key Syrian constituencies across political, social, ethnic and sectarian divides, in a way that contributes to sustainable peacebuilding; (3) strengthened development of mature and pragmatic political positions in preparation for engagement in a credible political process and the subsequent transitional arrangements; and (4) supported UN and international actors involved in the Track I process through channeling innovative and broadly sourced Syrian ideas on how to demonstrate possible avenues of compromise as part of a viable political settlement.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2019) include: (1) five TSG’s Intra-Syrian Dialogues were organized, which brought together a broad and representative spectrum of influential Syrian figures at the national level, aiming to develop consensus on key issues and generate proposals that could positively influence the Track I/constitutional process. Subjects included; efforts to advance a constitutional process and wider stabilization initiatives driven by international players; (2) five Joint Track Meetings were conducted in which representatives of independent and loyalist constituencies from inside Syria to engaged with oppositionists and other Syrians based outside the country, in a discreet and informal setting. These meetings have forum developed innovative proposals on advancing the political process, and broadening consensus on those proposals; and (3) three Arab-Kurdish dialogue brought together Arabs and Kurdish members of the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) to address reforms of their governance structures as a necessary step to ensure longer term stability in the region. Chief among Arab grievances are a lack of representation and a deficit in democratic practice. They called on the SDC to open up the space for civil society organizations (CSOs) and political parties/movements to practice freely and effectively, without fear of arrest or reprisal. Participants on both sides agreed a list of criteria which could help inform the SDC and CSOs on best practice.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Open Data for Development (OD4D) - Phase 2</title>
    <description>Open data – information from governments and other institutions made accessible to all - is becoming a major driver for social change, innovation and development, contributing to increasing trust in institutions, more transparent and accountable governance, more innovative economies, more effective service delivery and more engaged citizens. Through the Open Data for Development (OD4D) Program, Canada seeks to scale innovative approaches to help realize the full potential of open data to transform governments, civil society and business, to empower women and girls, and to ensure benefits for citizens in developing countries.  OD4D supports a coordinated network of initiatives and institutions around the world whose activities include providing training for civil society and government officials; evaluating the impact of open data; creating regional peer networks; and supporting governments to plan and implement open data policies. This second phase of OD4D will bring a particular focus to women empowerment and to capacity building in francophone Africa, the region most lagging in terms of open data access and use.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected intermediate outcomes for this project include: 1) new evidence on the link between gender empowerment, transparency, participation and development outcomes; 2) stronger Southern women's voices in the open government movement; 3) greater capacity in francophone Africa to develop and implement open data policies; 4) greater geographic coverage and cross-country benchmarking on open data issues.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>The Open Data for Development program has successfully advanced gender equality in the Open Government Partnership, scaled up open data activities in Francophone Africa, built data capacity in governments and civil society organizations, and nurtured data-related innovations to address development challenges. Over time, these achievements are expected to support greater accountability and transparency and to improve access to quality public services.  Specific results achieved at the end of Phase II (March 2020) included: 146 peer-reviewed publications on open data initiatives were published, of which 30% focused on gender issues; 44 developing country governments had received technical support; 73 open government commitments (from 24 developing countries) included a gender component; 695 public servants and 4,652 civil society participants (of which close to 50% were women) had taken part in training and capacity-building activities; a new open data hub in Burkina Faso provided capacity-building support in 15 countries and provided input for the 2019 Africa Data Revolution Report, the first such benchmarking exercise on the continent.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to the SUN Movement as a Global Nutrition Convenor</title>
    <description>The project aims to better support the health of women and girls in developing countries and to advocate for the importance of more gender-responsive nutrition policies. Launched in 2010, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement is a renewed effort to eliminate malnutrition based on the principle that everyone has a right to food and good nutrition. There are 60 SUN countries and 3 Indian States working towards the elimination of hunger and malnutrition.  Project activities contribute to: (1) promoting a comprehensive approach to the empowerment of women and girls; (2) advocating for an increased international investment in key gap areas such as nutrition; and (3) reaching the most vulnerable with effective nutrition interventions.  Global Affairs Canada contributes funding to the SUN Movement Secretariat and the SUN Movement Pooled Fund. The SUN Movement Secretariat (SMS) coordinates member action on nutrition, including advocating for more gender responsive nutrition policies and strengthening country capacity. The SUN Movement Pooled Fund is a source of small grants (in the range of USD $100,000 to USD $150,000 per year) that supports strengthening civil society associations’ participation in national multi-stakeholder platforms to scale up nutrition plans. The Canadian contribution aims to support up to 10 of these small grants for SUN countries.</description>

    <title>Digital Security Support for Civil Society Actors in Fragile Environments</title>
    <description>The purpose of this project is to enhance human rights defenders, civil society organizations and other activists’ abilities to network online by assisting them to secure their digital space and address cyber-attacks aimed at them. This is achieved through training and capacity building to individuals and organizations from these groups around the world. In addition, the project provides support to a Digital Security Helpline that services the above-mentioned populations to address their digital security risks.  This initiative supports open and inclusive environments where individuals or interest groups can advocate for their interests without fear of retribution which can lead to more stable societies. This includes advocacy that is undertaken online where the internet and cyberspace have become important platforms for free expression. Civil institutions’ media and human rights organizations’ websites and online communication platforms are frequently targeted and compromised by cyber-attack. This can happen often in fragile and conflict-affected states where civil society organizations and human right defenders are easily targeted through digital threats, mass surveillance and online censorship of opposition voices and online harassment.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis in the DRC - Emergency Medical Treatment - Doctors Without Borders (MSF) 2018</title>
    <description>November 2018 - A 10th outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on August 1, 2018. North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the DRC. The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with limited access and over one million internally displaced people. The continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania, represents a risk of spreading the outbreak to other provinces and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is helping to  meet the immediate medical needs of persons infected by or at risk of contracting Ebola in the affected health zones. MSF specializes in emergency health services and is the lead on Ebola treatment in the DRC. Project activities include: (1) establishing Ebola treatment centres in affected health zones; (2) improving medical management of patients and suspected cases; (3) improving surveillance, case management and infection management and control; and (4) raising awareness and immunization of at-risk groups.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of Canada’s contribution to this pooled fund include: (1) enhanced capacity to develop and deliver gender-sensitive security, justice and social services to women at risk, including refugee women; and (2) improved gender norms to recognize the importance of gender equality and the role of women in decision-making and in peacebuilding.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2020 include: (1) the project helped the security sector agencies (Jordanian Armed Forces-JAFand Public Security Directorate-PSD) increase the number of uniformed women in the field: JAF women officers increased to 1.4%, and PSD women officers increased to 5.92%. Jordanian women’s representation in UN Peacekeeping Missions  increased substantially in PSD from 3.6% in 2019 to 21.1%.  Also,  JAF increased its female representation from 13% to14%; (2) the project supported the PSD and the JAF to develop and start implementing their Gender Mainstreaming Strategies (GMS) for 2021-2024. In addition, with guidance from the project, the PSD and JAF created structures to oversee and report on the implementation of the GMS; (3) 113 judges, prosecutors and police officers from the Family Protection Department received training on how to handle gender-based violence (GBV) cases; social and legal and protection issues faced by refugees and vulnerable Jordanian women especially early marriage, inheritance rights and rights related to marriage and divorce under the Personal Status Law; (4) with UN Women’s technical assistance, the General Budget Department and the Jordanian National Commission for Women initiated a high-level discussion on introducting the Gender Functional Classification in various national budget preparation guidance. This supports the efforts on gender-responsive budgeting made by the project to date; (5) four women’s rights organizations (the Jordanian Women Union, Arab Women Organization, the Jordan National Forum for 1325, and Arab Renaissance for Democracy and Development) received funding to develop and implement awareness campaigns that address gender-based violence and provide service to gender violence survivors; (6) 11,612 women survivors of violence have increased access to GBV services, including psychosocial assistance, legal advice and shelter in Amman and seven other Governorates. Among them, about 20.5% received legal consultations, 78% received psychosocial consultations, and 1.5% (171 women survivors) benefited from quality shelter services in Amman; and (7) in collaboration with civil society partners, the project enhanced the visibility and progress related to Jordan’s implementation of its National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security. The total outreach of 285 social media and outdoor campaigns reached over 6 million people.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Gender and Social Protection in Iraq: Towards Women's Economic Empowerment</title>
    <description>The project aims to advance inclusive governance and women’s empowerment in Iraq by identifying legal barriers and constraints affecting women’s ability to work, and by supporting the drafting and effective implementation of legislation removing these legal barriers. The project works in partnership with the Secretariat General of the Council of Ministers, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. It supports the delivery of the Government of Iraq’s programs focusing on the economic and political empowerment of women. Project activities include: (1) providing technical assistance to review legislation and draft recommendations; (2) training government staff to conduct gender sensitization and awareness; and (3) publishing manuals and guidelines for use in policy development and legislative drafting.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include:  (1) reduced legal barriers to women’s economic and political empowerment; and (2) reduced social and psychological barriers to women’s empowerment, including those related to their capacities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (June 2022) include: (1) developed and disseminated a comprehensive report on the laws and policies that impact women’s rights in Iraq, particularly their economic rights; (2) provided recommendations for legislative reform that the Kurdistan region of Iraq integrated into revisions of its labour law and are informing revisions to Iraq’s federal labour law; (3) developed and disseminated an assessment of the main challenges affecting the implementation of existing laws; (4) developed and disseminated a gender mainstreaming toolkit and strengthened the capacity of 16 staff members from the Women’s Empowerment Directorate to use the toolkit to mainstream gender equality consideration into Iraq’s policies and legislation; (5) developed and disseminated a comprehensive review of women’s business leadership and skills training programs in Iraq to improve training programs and ensure more effective monitoring and evaluation of their impacts; (6) strengthened the capacity of 10 individuals from the Directorate of Non-Governmental and Civil Society Organizations to improve the service delivery to support women’s empowerment, and strengthened their capacity to transfer this knowledge to their peers; such as training of trainers; (7) strengthened the capacity of 14 Director Generals and Directors of women’s empowerment sections in key Ministries and the Iraqi Council of Ministers Secretariat to effectively deliver programs on women’s business and leadership skills; (8) developed and disseminated a study on the barriers that prevent Iraqi women from joining the workforce; (9) conducted a household survey to better understand how social norms and cultural beliefs influence women’s ability or decisions to participate in the workforce; (10) provided recommendations for social behaviour change campaigns currently integrated  into media campaigns implemented in federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq; (11) conducted a peer-reviewed study of women’s self-employment in Iraq targeting the poorest and most vulnerable and identified priorities for engagement by government and non-government organizations in the future; and (12) designed an economic inclusion pilot study focused on improving women’s self-employment opportunities in rural Iraq, which  is now being funded and implemented through another project.  Iraq and the Kurdistan region of Iraq actively use many of the reports and studies produced under this project to inform ongoing legislation revisions. They are also helping to increase the effectiveness and integration of gender equality and women’s empowerment programming implemented through other initiatives, including the Canada-funded Mashreq Gender Facility project.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Sectoral Budget Support in Sexual and Reproductive Health - Technical Assistance</title>
    <description>This technical assistance project aims to strengthen the Government of Mali's capacity to implement sector budget support that helps ensure the delivery of sexual and reproductive health services and care for women and girls. Technical assistance is a tool that helps achieve results, strengthen government structures in the health sector and promote the rights of women and girls, as well as contribute to fiduciary risk management.  Project activities include: (1) providing support to relevant Government of Mali ministries in strategic planning and the development of sexual and reproductive health policies, standards and procedures; (2) providing training at the national and regional levels for health care providers; (3) implementing a pilot project based on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to inform girls and boys about sexual and reproductive health and family planning services.  The direct beneficiaries of this technical assistance project are employees of the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene, and the Ministry of Women, Child and Family Promotion of Mali, and ultimately, women and girls in Mali who benefit from better sexual and reproductive health care.</description>

    <title>Supporting the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Burundi</title>
    <description>This project supports the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi (OHCHR) to ensure that it maintains its operations in the country from June 2018-March 2019. The on-going political, security, economic and human rights crisis requires a strong OHCHR presence in Burundi. OHCHR-Burundi systematically monitors the institutions and places of detention, essentially all those where violations are known to occur, to document them and recommend preventive measures and remedies to dissuade further abuses from occurring. OHCHR-Burundi’s monitoring activities also serve as a basis for reporting to relevant actors in Geneva and New York in order to inform the ongoing political dialogue on the situation of the country and to inform the diplomatic community through regular briefings organised in the country.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthen rule of law and accountability for human rights violations; (2) enhance and protect civic spaces and people’s participation; (3) Integrate human rights in sustainable development, and (4) ensure early warning, prevention and protection of human rights in situations of conflict and insecurity.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2018) include: (1) engaged 60 lawyers and 20 human rights defenders in training sessions on the effective implementation of the state’s law on the Protection of Victims, Witnesses and other Persons at Risk; (2) facilitated the participation of 130 people (of which 69 women) in Women’s Day activities on the impact of the state’s laws on gender-based violence; and (3) produced 231 daily reports and 11 monthly reports on the human rights situation in Burundi.  This project ended abruptly as the partner, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), was forced to leave Burundi and has not returned. For this reason, some project activities were not accomplished; however, the project did achieve the results described above.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to Gender Advisors in MINUSMA - Mali</title>
    <description>This project aims to address gender expertise capacity gaps within the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) by supporting two MINUSMA gender advisors, located in regional offices. The armed conflict in Mali has had a dramatic impact on women and children, contributing to an increased need to fully incorporate gender considerations at all levels. Integrating gender considerations, as well as promoting and implementing the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda are part of the MINUSMA mandate, and are necessary for a more effective peace operation.</description>

    <title>Support to Gender Advisors in MINUSCA - Central African Republic</title>
    <description>This project aims to address gender expertise capacity gaps within the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA).  Women are essential actors that must be included in decision-making structures to enable a durable and lasting peace. Gender expertise in the mission is critical for the delivery of core Women, Peace and Security (WPS) priorities. In a bid to enhance women’s meaningful participation, the project supports two gender advisors, located in regional offices. These gender advisors lead the mobilization and capacity building of local women’s organizations to contribute to effective representation and participation in local peace and reconciliation efforts.</description>

    <title>Support to the Municipal and Regional Electoral Process in Tunisia</title>
    <description>The goal of this project is to improve the integrity of and support the municipal and regional electoral process in Tunisia scheduled for May 2018. The project provides tailored approaches to rural areas with higher illiteracy rates to ensure women have equal opportunities to participate in the electoral process.  Project activities include: (1) providing training to targeted civil society organizations to strengthen their organizational capacity to observe municipal elections throughout the country, and ensure gender equity among observers; (2) providing training to 300 new women ambassadors so they are equipped with outreach tools to interact face-to-face with registered women and persuade them to vote; and (3) civic educators conduct targeted civic and voter education campaigns for rural illiterate women, youth and marginalized groups, through radio programming, videos or coffee talks.  Through GAC’s support, this project contributes to a USAID project by expanding current outreach activities for illiterate rural women in both geographic coverage and scope reaching up to 7.6 million radio listeners and viewers.</description>

    <title>Women’s Voice and Leadership - Indonesia - PEKKA Foundation</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organisations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting activities, building institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the globally recognized, significant gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  This project is being implemented by Yayasan Pemberdayaan PEKKA (PEKKA Foundation) [Women-Headed Family Empowerment (PEKKA) Foundation], a national women’s right organization in Indonesia. Through this project, PEKKA Foundation provides funding to 16 Indonesian local women’s rights organizations (WROs) at national and sub-national levels (Pekka unions), to strengthen their knowledge, capacity and skills related to paralegal services and livelihood opportunities. Project activities include:  (1) providing fast and responsive support to organizations for discrete activities and short projects to enable timely and strategic responses to unforeseen events;  (2) reinforcing and training PEKKA’s network of WROs for women-headed households to engage in village policy- and budget-making decisions, and to access paralegal services and market-based livelihood opportunities;  and (3) strengthening networking capacity and skills related to paralegal services and livelihood opportunities among the organizations to work from the grassroots to national level.</description>

    <title>Emergency Assistance in Nigeria and Somalia - FAO 2018</title>
    <description>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) focuses on developing, protecting and restoring sustainable livelihoods so that the integrity of societies that depend on farming, livestock, fish, forests and other natural resources is not threatened by crises. FAO contributes to a quicker and more sustainable recovery of local food production while preserving development gains, reducing dependency on aid and increasing self-reliance of crisis-affected populations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, FAO is providing emergency assistance to over 4.3 million people affected by conflict and acute food insecurity in Nigeria and Somalia. Project activities include: (1) distributing agricultural inputs, such as nutrition-sensitive seeds, tools and fishing kits; (2) cash transfers and cash-for-work activities; (3) livestock support and veterinary inputs, such as vaccines, mineral blocks, fodder seed, collapsible water tanks and water trucking; (4) training in agricultural techniques; and (5) supporting emergency control measures of fall armyworm.</description>

    <title>Cameroon – Multisector Humanitarian Aid – L’Œuvre Léger 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Cameroon is experiencing three distinct humanitarian crises in 2019: (i) violence in northeastern Nigeria, cross-border raids and suicide attacks have caused massive displacements in the Far North region; (ii) conflict and insecurity in the Central African Republic continue to cause an influx of refugees east of the country; (iii) social tensions in the North-West and South-West – the “Anglophone regions” – have led to armed conflict between non-governmental armed groups and national security forces, leading to massive internal displacement. The country is vulnerable to food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to adequate basic social services.  With GAC’s support, Œuvre Léger is helping to assist up to 108 718 conflict-affected people in the Far North region. Project activities include: (1) constructing up to 16 water points, benefiting up to 14,000 people; (2) providing free health services for up to 18,000 people; (3) raising awareness on good hygiene practices, benefiting up to 20,000 people; (4) providing treatment against severe acute malnutrition to up to 1,000 children under the age of five; (5) providing cash support to farmers and vulnerable producers to meet their basic needs during welding periods; and (6) providing support to farmers, producers and traders to better organize production and increase their productivity.</description>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Assistance in the North-West and South-West Regions - NRC 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Cameroon is experiencing three distinct humanitarian crises in 2019: (i) violence in northeastern Nigeria, cross-border raids and suicide attacks have caused massive displacements in the Far North region; (ii) conflict and insecurity in the Central African Republic continue to cause an influx of refugees east of the country; (iii) social tensions in the North-West and South-West – the “Anglophone regions” – have led to armed conflict between non-governmental armed groups and national security forces, leading to massive internal displacement. The country is vulnerable to food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to adequate basic social services.  With GAC’s support, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is helping to assist up to 15,000 conflict-affected people in the North-West and South-West. Project activities include: (1) providing adequate shelter and essential basic items to 2,500 vulnerable households; (2) distributing dignity kits for women and girls, which contain items required to maintain feminine hygiene, dignity and respect in their daily lives, benefiting up to 3,000 women and girls; (3) constructing or rehabilitating household emergency latrines, benefiting up to 2,000 people; and (4) building the capacity of local NGOs to address gender and protection, and their understanding of humanitarian and “Do No Harm” principles.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Hygiene and Livelihoods Assistance – Action Against Hunger 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 14.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and a total of 4.3 million people have been displaced over the last four years. Yemen is also facing one of the worst cholera epidemics in recorded history, as well as a diphtheria outbreak, the scale of which is compounded by the dire state of water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and health services. Nearly half of health facilities have been destroyed or are only partially functioning, stocks of medical supplies are low, and many health professionals are working for free or receiving substantially reduced wages. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger is providing emergency food, livelihoods, water, sanitation and hygiene to up to 71,000 conflict-affected people in the Lahj and Abyan governorates in the south of Yemen. This project aims to reduce the risk of cholera, and the use of negative coping mechanisms within the targeted communities, paying particular attention to the needs of women and girls. Project activities include: (1) providing cash assistance; (2) promoting hygiene (including menstrual hygiene); and (3) rehabilitating water and sanitation facilities.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased use of gender-sensitive food security services for the most vulnerable conflict-affected groups; and (2) increased gender-sensitive use of essential water, sanitation and hygiene services by the most conflict-affected populations, with a particular focus on women and girls’ safety and dignity.  The expected ultimate outcome is lives saved, suffering alleviated and human dignity maintained in countries experiencing humanitarian crisis or that are facing acute food insecurity.</expectedResults>

    <title>Tanzania - Access to Basic Services for Burundian Refugees - Oxfam Canada 2018</title>
    <description>March 2018 – As a result of the political tension and insecurity ongoing in neighbouring Burundi since 2015, north-western Tanzania now hosts approximately 275,000 Burundian refugees and asylum-seekers. Tanzania is also host to some 85,000 Congolese refugees. Altogether, the high number of refugees has strained the local response capacity of both Tanzanian authorities and aid agencies. Inadequate access to water, food and shelter remain key challenges across all three refugee camps. There is a critical need for international support to continue to provide basic services and safe and dignified conditions for all refugees.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam Canada is providing water and sanitation, protection, and livelihoods support to an estimated 129,500 Burundian refugees and host community members living in or around the Nduta refugee camp in Kigoma region, Tanzania.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, Nutrition and Protection Assistance - World Vision 2018</title>
    <description>As of March 2018, an estimated 7 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline, and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and over 2.4 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 5.1 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many conflict areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, World Vision Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and protection services for up to 125,916 conflict-affected people in Upper Nile state. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitate the key water and sanitation facilities in 10 targeted schools and 4 health clinics and forming four community water management committees; (2) implementing Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition and screening 13,725 children and 5,779 pregnant and lactating women, and (3) reaching 10,000 women, men, boys and girls with gender-based violence service and referral information.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees and Host Communities in Ethiopia - MSF 2019</title>
    <description>In 2019, drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Canada is providing ongoing support to Gambella Hospital, the only top-level medical facility with surgical capacity serving a combined population of roughly one million South Sudanese refugees and Ethiopian host communities. In 2019, MSF is focusing on sexual and reproductive health services, including psychosocial and mental health support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Chad - Emergency Assistance in Lac Province - CARE Canada 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Chad faces interconnected humanitarian crises in a context of chronic poverty, food insecurity and low economic and social development. The security situation in neighbouring countries continues to generate population movements, particularly from the Central African Republic (CAR) in the south, from Sudan in the east, as well as internal displacement in the Lac province. This context has left nearly 4.3 million people (of which 51% are women) in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. Moreover, nutritional needs have increased by 29% compared to the beginning of 2018.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is helping to assist up to 19,347 conflict-affected people in the Lac province. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating water points, benefiting up to 5,000 people; (2) distributing cash-for-work to up to 4,200 beneficiaries for work on small community projects, and providing unconditional cash assistance to up to 434 vulnerable people; (3) provide small pre-vaccinated ruminants to rebuild the livestock of up to 1,000 households; (4) building the capacity of up to 1,000 women and girls to manage income generating activities and resources such as land, water and pasture; and (5) distributing dignity kits for women and girls, which contain items required to maintain feminine hygiene, dignity and respect in their daily lives, benefiting up to 1,000 women and girls.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Assistance for the Americas - IOM 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and record hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance including basic health support, food security and nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation assistance.  With GAC’s support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working in ODA- eligible countries in the Americas to help support the response to the Venezuela refugee and migrant situation in the region.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter kits, non-food items and multi-purpose cash; (2) coordinating camp management for IDPs in United Nations bases; (3) deploying mobile teams to remote locations where affected populations lack water, sanitation and hygiene services; (4) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene; (5) supporting humanitarian organizations by: (i) establishing lightweight camps in deep field locations, heavy base camps and national NGO support centres; and (ii) providing cargo transport services; (6) data collection that includes mapping of vulnerable populations at points of entry, and at the district and community levels for enhanced targeting and delivery of assistance; and (7) protection and gender mainstreaming across humanitarian response activities for extremely vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied migrant children, and single women and adolescent girls.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Assistance for Displaced Persons - Save the Children Canada 2019</title>
    <description>In 2019, drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is helping to address the health and nutrition needs of up to 39,000 people displaced by the conflicts in the Dawa zone of Ethiopia’s Somali region and Gedeo zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples region through support to local health facilities. Given the increased risk of violence for displaced women and girls, the project is focusing on enhancing the capacity of local health facilities to treat acute malnutrition, respond to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), and provide sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services.</description>

    <title>Nigeria - Emergency Assistance in Borno State - CARE Canada 2019-2020</title>
    <description>March 2019 - The conflict between the Boko Haram and Nigerian armed forces has been ongoing for over 10 years. Across the three affected states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, approximately 7.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019 out of the total population of 13.4 million. Assistance for basic survival and protection is vital for displaced populations, host communities and vulnerable people across north-eastern Nigeria, especially in Borno State, the epicenter of the crisis.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is helping to assist up to 47,000 conflict-affected people in the Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing mobile clinics to offer emergency sexual and reproductive health services, benefiting up to 30,000 vulnerable people; (2) training of up to 32 healthcare service providers on sexual and reproductive health services in three primary healthcare centers (PHC); (3) providing reproductive health kits and equipment to three PHC, including essential medicines, contraceptives, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and delivery beds; (4) distributing delivery kits, which contain items required to ensure safe and clean deliveries, benefiting up to 8,100 pregnant women; and (5) creating and training three gender-based violence Protection Committees, benefiting up to 3,000 people, mostly women and children.</description>

    <title>Support to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Decades of political instability have left Somalia facing a complex and protracted humanitarian crises with an estimated 4.2 million Somalis (35 percent of the population) expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2019. Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to the basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities, such as shelter, healthcare and protection, by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Creating a Gender Hub - UN Women</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya refugees already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The majority of the refugees are women and children.  With GAC’s support, UN Women works to establish a Gender Hub in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The Gender Hub helps address knowledge and capacity gaps among humanitarian actors in order to strengthen gender-responsive humanitarian action and improve service delivery and outcomes for women and girls affected by this crisis. Project activities include: (1) developing and delivering training courses for international and local humanitarian actors involved in the refugee response on gender awareness and gender sensitivity, gender and diversity, and gender and gender-based violence mainstreaming; and (2) acting as a knowledge management center and gathering assessments and research data to help humanitarian actors strengthen knowledge and evidence-base to design humanitarian interventions with greater impact.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Development and Peace 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace is helping to provide safe shelters and secure settlements to Rohingya refugees in the camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Project activities include: (1) distributing material for transitional shelters and upgrades to existing shelters according to priorities identified by refugee households; (2) providing house-to-house technical assistance following the distribution of shelter materials; (3) providing gender sensitive semi-permanent shelters for particularly vulnerable households, such as women or child-headed households; and (4) providing solar lighting and other site improvements.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis - World Vision 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months.These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, World Vision Canada is helping to meet the needs of Rohingya refugees with comprehensive programming to protect them from gender-based violence (GBV). Project activities include: (1) conducting awareness-raising sessions at various community protection spaces on sexual and reproductive health, child rights, good hygiene practices, and socialization for adolescent girls and boys; (2) mobilizing communities to conduct awareness-raising sessions on GBV and child protection violations, including child marriage; (3) providing case by case support to children and women at risk as identified; (4) providing psychosocial support to vulnerable girls and boys at community protection spaces; and (5) providing gender and age-appropriate livelihood opportunities, via cash-for-work activities.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to Rohingya Refugee Crisis - Oxfam Canada 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 735,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. These refugees joined some 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh following earlier waves of displacement. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs  With GAC’s support, Oxfam Canada is helping to meet the essential water, sanitation, hygiene and protection needs of Rohingya refugees affected by this crisis, Bangladesh. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating existing water and sanitation facilities; (2) constructing gender sensitive communal latrines based on women and girl-led designs; (3) conducting hygiene promotion in refugee and host community schools; and (4) training of local authorities and traditional leaders on women and girls’ roles and rights, legal entitlements, protection and referral pathways.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency and Medical Humanitarian Response - Doctors Without Borders 2019-2020</title>
    <description>February 2019 – From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as Ituri province, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2018 has pushed the limits of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services, has exacerbated live-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt of this context, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict, and where widespread human rights abuses and sexual violence are prevalent. In 2018, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders aims to help address the humanitarian and medical needs of up to 300,000 people per year in 16 provinces of the DRC. The project focuses on providing urgent lifesaving emergency preventative, primary and secondary healthcare, and, through improved surveillance, early detection of possible disease outbreaks, and quick assessment and response to disease outbreaks and medical and humanitarian emergencies.  Project activities include: (1) provide outpatient consultations to population in area of response; (2) provide testing, diagnoses and treatment of main morbidities; (3) distribute non-food item (NFI) kits including bed nets and sanitation supplies; and (4) provide individual and group counselling/mental health sessions to vulnerable groups of women, children and adolescents, including survivors of sexual and/or gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Emergency Health Care - Doctors without Borders Canada 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.3 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.2 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, Doctors without Borders Canada is providing emergency health services for up to 167,000 conflict affected people in Upper Nile and Jonglei states. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, including 38,000 malaria patients treated and 52,000 vaccinations; (2) providing sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including 6,684 post-natal consultations and 3,440 assisted deliveries;  and (3) providing secondary healthcare services, including 3,969 inpatient admissions and 1,400 malnutrition cases treated with therapeutic feeding.</description>

    <title>Emergency Funding in Africa - Sexual and Reproductive Health of Women and Girls - UNFPA 2019</title>
    <description>With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is contributing to meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable women and girls in Africa, and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. During conflicts, natural disasters and other complex emergencies, sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls must not be overlooked. It is essential to ensure life-saving interventions related to sexual and reproductive health services, and to provide protection from and response to sexual and gender-based violence for women and girls. This unearmarked regional funding provides UNFPA the flexibility to respond to emerging needs or underfunded operations throughout Africa.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency obstetric care, and sexual and reproductive health services to women and adolescent girls; (2) ensuring protection from and response to gender-based violence; and (3) providing health services, supplies, commodities and medication, dignity kits, and reproductive health kits to crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - International Rescue Committee 2019-2020</title>
    <description>February 2019 – From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as the Ituri province, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2018 has pushed the limits of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services, has exacerbated life-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt of this context, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict, and where widespread human rights abuses and sexual violence are prevalent. In 2018, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee is providing assistance to help address the urgent needs of up to 125,249 conflict-affected people in territories of Beni and Lubero in the North Kivu province, DRC. This project focuses on improving access to emergency health services, and increasing the safety and protection of conflict-affected women, adolescent girls and girls. Project activities include: (1) procuring up to 6 health facilities and 6 mobile clinics with equipment, vaccines and essential drugs for the treatment of pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea; (2) establishing up to 12 referral systems for emergency cases requiring specialized care; (3) providing training to up to 24 health facility staff members on the use of available supplies, materials, and emergency obstetric care; and (4) distributing up to 3164 dignity kits to girls and women in targeted communities.</description>

    <title>Mali - Emergency Assistance - ACTED 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - Due to increased peacekeeping and military operations in the centre and north of the country, violent conflict spiked in 2018, causing new displacement in the centre of the country (Segou, Mopti), as well as in the far north. High levels of vulnerability continue to dominate the populations in Gao and Timbuktu regions, where humanitarian access remains difficult. Food insecurity, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition and protection remain high priorities for humanitarian interventions in Mali. Seasonal flooding, cyclical drought, intercommunal conflict and a lack of basic services continue to exacerbate vulnerability displacement; approximately 2.5 million people are food insecure and 750,000 children under 5 are malnourished. Approximately 755,000 people are in need of immediate protection services. With GAC’s support, an NGO partner is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 116,400 conflict-affected people. This project focuses on nutrition and on increasing access to safe drinking WASH facilities in and around health and nutrition facilities. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 6 water points; (2) treating up to 3,000 girls and boys suffering from severe acute malnutrition; and (3) providing protection services for victims of SGBV for up to 55,200 people.</description>

    <title>DRC – Emergency Assistance – People in Need – 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as Ituri, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and IDPs, 2019 pushed the limits of DRC's humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services exacerbated live-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict and where widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence, are a defining feature. In 2018 alone, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, People in Need (PIN)fournit une assistance pour répondre aux besoins urgents de 53 884 personnes affectées par le conflit dans le territoire de Kabambare, en RDC. Ce projet se concentre sur l'amélioration des conditions d'eau, d'assainissement et d'hygiène des structures sanitaires, la prévention et le traitement de la malnutrition, et la fourniture de services de santé de base aux populations touchées par le conflit. Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) distribuer jusqu'à 28 trousses médicales aux structures sanitaires existantes ; 2) fournir des trousses d'assainissement et d'hygiène aux structures sanitaires ; 3) former jusqu'à 60 volontaires de la santé communautaire ; 4) distribuer des intrants et du matériel nutritionnels pour la malnutrition aiguë sévère.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies - World Health Organization 2019</title>
    <description>The Contingency Fund for Emergencies of the World Health Organization (WHO) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial, acute response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  The support of GAC and other donors to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies helps WHO react early to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess the threat of different outbreaks; and (2) initiating urgent activities to prevent the spread of outbreaks, such as the delivery of vital health supplies, the training of community health workers, the provision of potable water and the implementation of vaccination campaign.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Common Humanitarian Fund - UNDP 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.3 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.2 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, the South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund is providing timely allocations to national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies to meet critical humanitarian needs of people throughout the country. The Fund is managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office. Support to the Fund is helping to achieve its objectives, including: (1) promoting early action and response to reduce loss of life; (2) enhancing response to time-critical humanitarian requirements; and (3) strengthening core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises.</description>

    <title>Cyclone Idai in Mozambique - Emergency Response Unit of the Canadian Red Cross 2019</title>
    <description>April 2019 – On March 15, 2019, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique before continuing inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, causing substantial loss of life and injury. The cyclone resulted in severe damage to infrastructure, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, and thousands of hectares of standing crops. An estimated three million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the region.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross deployed a Health Emergency Response Unit (ERU) to Mozambique to enhance health services within affected communities. The ERU is helping to meet the immediate needs of up to an estimated 5000 direct beneficiaries. Health services that are being provided include emergency obstetric and newborn care, general surgery, internal medicine, sexual and reproductive health, and psychosocial support.</description>

    <title>Cyclone Idai Matching Fund - Humanitarian Coalition 2019</title>
    <description>On March 15, 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe causing significant devastation to communities, destroying homes and infrastructure. Many communities remain cut off by flooding, without communications or electricity. Across the region, hundreds of people have been killed and many more remain missing. According to the United Nations, more than 3 million people have been affected by the cyclone. An effective and timely humanitarian assistance response is essential to address the immediate life-saving needs of the affected people. In order to address this humanitarian crisis, Global Affairs Canada (GAC) launched the Cyclone Idai Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Consistent with the terms of the GAC matching fund mechanism, the Government of Canada is matching the eligible donations made by individuals to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members, which reached the maximum announced matching amount of $2 million. Through this project, GAC is transferring the matching funds to the Humanitarian Coalition, which in turn allocates the funds amongst its members based on criteria such as their capacity and presence in the affected regions. The funds are used by Humanitarian Coalition members for humanitarian response activities, such as the provision of emergency health, protection, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene services.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, and Nutrition Assistance - Concern 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - An estimated 7.1 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.9 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.3 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.2 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, Concern Worldwide is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition assistance for up to 113,366 displaced and conflict-affected people in Unity and Central Equatoria states of South Sudan. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating and operating 10 boreholes equipped with hand pumps in Rubkona and Guit counties; (2) constructing 32 communal latrines, and 100 handwashing stations in the Bentiu Protection of Civilian site; and (3) delivering outpatient therapeutic programs, targeted supplementary feeding programs and infant and young child feeding services for 14,596 children and 3,574 pregnant and lactating women across all project sites.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Health, Nutrition and Protection in Colombia - ACF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is helping address the basic health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection needs of up to 14,100 crisis-affected people in the departments of Guajira and Norte de Santander in Columbia. Project activities include: (1) providing prenatal and postnatal health check-ups; (2) delivering safe drinking water by providing water filters at reception points; (3) providing nutritional assistance (screening and treatment) to up to 1,080 pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of five; (4) providing emergency cash-based transfers to vulnerable households; and (6) providing training on basic hygiene practices, and waste management , and promoting hygiene to up to 5,000 crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Basic Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - More than 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of them currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting more than one million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crises-affected people, including host communities, need basic health care, food and nutritional assistance, protection services, shelter and clean water.  With the support of Global Affairs Canada, Médecins du Monde is helping to improve the health of up to 37,300 people affected by the Venezuelan crisis in the department of Nariño in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and reproductive health services to approximately 2,000 vulnerable women and adolescent girls; (2) providing medical, mental health and psychosocial counselling to approximately 5,000 people affected by the crisis; (3) training health personnel on health care for the migrant population; and (4) training community organizations and Venezuelan associations on the right to health, gender equality, prevention of violence and sexual exploitation.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis in the DRC - Emergency Medical Response - IFRC 2019</title>
    <description>August 1, 2018 - A 10th outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the DRC. These provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, and over one million internally displaced people. The continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, represents a risk of spreading the outbreak to other provinces and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Appeal works to support Red Cross Societies’ staff and volunteers to carry out relief operations focussed on epidemic control through: community-based surveillance and response mechanisms; safe and dignified burials; risk communication; social mobilization and community engagement; infection prevention and control; support to health facilities and communities; and psychosocial support.  The project  includes the DRC response, and preparedness activities in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda. Project activities include: (1) establishing and maintaining  infection prevention and control measures in health facilities; (2) providing psychosocial support to Ebola patients and their families; (3) conducting advocacy and community outreach on Ebola prevention, detection and control; and (4) advocating for access by humanitarian personnel to affected and at-risk communities.</description>

    <title>Supporting the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Stabilization of Mali</title>
    <description>This project supports the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (CVJR) in order to implement the priority areas of its response strategy and action plan for stabilization in Mali.  The project aims to increase the Commission’s capacity, especially that of the units responsible for truth seeking and investigations: 1) to support and make reparations to victims; 2) with respect to gender-related issues; 3) to hold public hearings; 4) to ensure widespread impact of this public process through a continued national communications campaign.  The project supports the implementation of the Algiers Peace Agreement and complements the role played by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in its efforts with the CVJR.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected results for this project include: 1) The CVJR is better equipped to investigate and shed light on human rights violations committed during conflicts and other episodes of armed violence, including sexual violence and other violations against women and girls; 2) The CVJR is better equipped to ensure that victims, especially women and girls, are heard at public hearings; 3)  The CVJR is better equipped to produce a final report that includes recommendations to the State; 4)The CVJR is better able to engage victims and the authorities responsible for the implementation of its recommendations.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2021 include: (1) 26 new actions out of a targeted 20 were developed to enable the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (CVJR) to be a catalyst for peace, including the drafting of 12 investigative reports, 4 reports on psychological support for victims and 3 leaflets on deprivations of the right to liberty; (2) 80% of stakeholders involved report that the CVJR contributes effectively to the national dialogue on peace and reconciliation, which is a very satisfactory result overall taking into consideration the lack of trust between civil society and other Malian institutions; (3) 3 public hearings held during the project focused on deprivations of the right to liberty, deprivations of the right to life, and enforced disappearances, respectively. The project’s key outcomes impacted a wide range of beneficiaries, including victims, the public, CVJR employees, journalists, authorities and interpreters; (4) all women involved in the project expressed satisfaction with their participation in the public hearings, and all the CVJR employees involved in the public hearings could describe good practices that enabled women and girls’ participation, against an 85% target; (5) drafting committee members of the final report felt confident in their ability to produce a final report that is accessible to victims and includes recommendations to the state. All CVJR members tested could describe good practices on measures likely to ensure the conflict does not recur; and (6) civil society organizations partnering in the project consider that their ability to document serious human rights violations has increased to 100%, exceeding the target of 75%. In addition, 86 victims (including 71 women) out of a targeted 85 were represented before the national and supranational courts.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Expanding Access to Health and Rights for Women and Girls in Haiti</title>
    <description>This project addresses gaps in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women and girls in Haiti. More particularly, this project strengthens and scales up previous work on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), and gender equality in the eleven clinical sites of the Lower Artibonite and Central Plateau. Project activities include: (1) addressing the most urgent clinical needs of survivors of SGBV; (2) ensuring that those in positions of authority at the health, judicial and community levels are educated and engaged in the reduction, mitigation and prevention of SGBV through surveillance committees, created to support survivors and promoting survivors’ rights; and (3) engaging girls, women, boys and men in an educational and empowering approach towards gender issues that aims to increase the resiliency of women and girls, and change social norms around SGBV.  This project is expected to reach 1.1 million people, while also strengthening linkages with broader women’s health services, community health programs, and Haitian civil society organizations.  This project is implemented through a partnership between Partners in Health Canada, and its Haitian sister organization, Zanmi Lasante.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis - Humanitarian Assistance in the DRC - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>October 2019 – The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been battling its 10th Ebola outbreak since August 1, 2018. It is second only to the 2014 West Africa outbreak in magnitude. As of September 11, 2019, there have been 3,099 cases of Ebola in the DRC with 2,074 deaths. In addition, four deaths were reported in Uganda between June and August 2019. On July 17, 2019, the WHO declared this outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”, a designation that indicates that a crisis has the potential for global reach.  With GAC’s support, this project aims to provide funding to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to bring together humanitarian actors and Congolese authorities in order to ensure a coherent response to the ongoing crisis. Project activities include: (1) advocating for multi-sectorial coordination for humanitarian response; (2) supporting operation readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries; and (3) strengthening the emergency telecommunications system.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis – Humanitarian Assistance to Displaced People – UNICEF 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance including basic health support, food security and nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation assistance.  With GAC’s support, UNICEF is helping to reduce the vulnerability and maintain the dignity of displaced Venezuelans in various countries of South America and the Caribbean region. Project activities include: (1) increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; (2) providing basic healthcare; (3) treating children for severe acute malnutrition; (4) providing emergency education programming for children; and (5) ensuring protection services for children and women.</description>

    <title>Iraq Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>July 2019 – In 2019, there are an estimated 6.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq, 18% of the total population. More than 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced, despite the expulsion of ISIL from Iraqi territory in December 2017. Displaced people both in-camp and out-of-camp settings continue to depend on the provision of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages the Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF), which allocates resources to national and international humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of crisis-affected populations throughout Iraq. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving and life-sustaining activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination and leadership primarily through the Humanitarian Coordinator function, and by leveraging the humanitarian cluster system; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with national and international partners.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis in the DRC - Emergency Medical Treatment - Doctors Without Borders (MSF) 2019/20</title>
    <description>October 2019 - A 10th outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on August 1, 2018. North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the DRC. The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with limited access and over one million internally displaced people. The continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania, represents a risk of spreading the outbreak to other provinces and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is helping to meet the immediate medical needs of persons infected by or at risk of contracting Ebola in the affected health zones. MSF specializes in emergency health services and is the lead on Ebola treatment in the DRC. Project activities include: (1) increasing access to quality primary healthcare and isolation centres for women, girls, men and boys living in the Ebola affected health zones; (2) increasing awareness about prevention measures and availability of treatment, through affected communities; (3) improving surveillance, case management and infection management and control; and (4) raising awareness and immunization of at-risk groups.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Assessment and Coordination of Humanitarian Response - OCHA/UNDAC 2019-2022</title>
    <description>This project aims to support the United Nations Disaster Assistance and Coordination (UNDAC) emergency system in providing timely and reliable humanitarian needs assessments and coordination support to the international community and affected countries following humanitarian crises. UNDAC is managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and consists of more than 220 national emergency experts from more than 80 countries. It is designed to help meet the needs for early information during the first phase of a sudden-onset emergency, as well as to support the coordination of incoming international humanitarian assistance at a national level or at the site of the emergency. The UNDAC system is capable of deploying emergency response teams within 24 to 48 hours, anywhere in the world.  Project activities include: (1) conducting training and capacity development for emergency response team members; and (2) managing the deployment of Canadian and developing-country delegates as part of emergency response teams.</description>

    <title>East Africa Drought - Humanitarian Response - FAO 2019</title>
    <description>June 2019 - Two years after the 2016-2017 drought brought Somalia and parts of Ethiopia to the brink of famine, severe climatic conditions are again pushing the Horn of Africa towards a major humanitarian emergency. Currently, an estimated 11.4 million people are facing acute food insecurity due to drought or displacement in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda. Without immediate humanitarian action, it is estimated that as many as 17 million people across the region could be acutely food insecure as soon as August.  With support from GAC and other international donors, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is protecting the livelihoods of nearly 1.9 million vulnerable drought-affected households in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Uganda. Project activities include: (1) providing cash-for-work and other income-generation opportunities to allow families to meet their basic needs without resorting to negative coping strategies, which can include early and child marriage or sex work; and (2) protecting vital livestock assets through the provision of feed, water and medicine, as well as efforts to cull herds where needed.</description>

    <title>Support for Evidence-Based Decision-Making and Assessment Capacities - 2019-2021</title>
    <description>This project, also known as the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS), aims to improve coordinated multi-sector needs assessments before, during, or after the humanitarian response to global humanitarian crises.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the project provides evidence-based analysis for decision-making during humanitarian crises. Project activities include: (1) developing innovative needs assessment methodologies and tools in order to provide faster, more precise and cost effective assessments of humanitarian crises; and (2) training organizations and experts to build a roster of trained deployable assessment experts.  This project is being implemented by a consortium of two international non-governmental organizations: Save the Children and the Norwegian Refugee Council.</description>

This project works to enhance the evidence base on humanitarian financing for decision-makers and develop an understanding of the needs of, resources required, and data gaps to provide humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected populations, especially women and children.  Project activities include: (1) developing subject-specific reports and briefings; (2) contribute to the production of the Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Report; (3) investing in the online Development Data Hub, through which users can access financial and resource flow data alongside poverty, social and vulnerability indicators; (4) engaging in key humanitarian fora to increase awareness and use of Development Initiative’s research and evidence; (5) consolidating Development Initiative’s research to help make it a trusted platform for information and analysis about crisis financing; and (6) continuing the “helpdesk” service which directly responds to users to help them understand and use the Development Initiative’s data and analysis.</description>

    <title>UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women</title>
    <description>This project aims to prevent and address violence against women and girls in developing countries, including targeted funding for women and girls living with disabilities. The project supports the United Nations Trust Fund (UNTF) to End Violence against Women, a global, multilateral, grant-making mechanism that supports innovative, evidence-based civil society and women-led solutions, with a focus on preventing violence against women and girls, implementing laws and policies to address and eliminate violence against them, and improving access to services for survivors. Project activities include: (1) mobilizing, delivering and effectively managing funds for initiatives that prevent and address violence against women and girls; (2) creating a platform for harvesting, analysing and disseminating useful lessons from the results of UNTF initiatives that measurably inform policy and programming on violence against women and girls; and (3) creating partnerships and mobilizing support for increased funding and commitments to end violence against women and girls.</description>

    <title>Gender Equality in Artisanal Mining</title>
    <description>The project aims to support women working in the Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) sector to tackle the barriers they face, with respect to achieving full gender equality in the ASM sector.  The project works in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Zimbabwe and aims to provide women with the tools to gain economic security, independence and voice, coupled with meaningful space in decision-making structures that have a direct impact on their livelihoods (e.g. mining cooperatives). The project also aims to ensure that the ASM physical environment is better protected to ensure that mining is carried out in ways that do not have a negative impact on women and their communities, and empower women to articulate and defend their concerns, including health and safety concerns that are often overlooked or disregarded as of lesser importance.  Project activities include: (1) providing technical assistance to legislators, policy and other decision-makers on how to apply gender assessment tools to new and existing laws, regulations, policies and initiatives; (2) raising awareness for relevant stakeholders on how to combat harmful social stigma and cultural taboos that remain as an obstacle to women’s full economic participation in the mineral supply chain; and (3) providing technical assistance to women of ASM communities to develop relevant skills (financial literacy, management and business) to more actively defend their interests and participate in mining cooperatives.  The project aims to directly benefit an estimated 1,000 women and men working at project artisanal mine sites in the three targeted countries.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved laws, regulations, policies and initiatives created and/or adapted and implemented by governments in DRC, Uganda and Zimbabwe that are enhancing women’s security and gender equality in the mining sector; (2) improved economic benefits for women derived from mineral supply chains in DRC, Uganda and Zimbabwe; and (3) improved environmental conditions of ASM mining communities in DRC, Uganda and Zimbabwe, prioritizing conditions that affect women most negatively.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2022) include: (1) increased women’s peace and security in mining associations by 22% in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 35% in Uganda and 5% in Zimbabwe as per the 2022 WPS Index; (2) improved women’s economic empowerment in Uganda by 18% and in Zimbabwe by 15% as measured by the Women's Economic Empowerment Index; (3) reached 1,244 (784 women) artisanal miners, surpassing the target by 17%. This total represents nearly 70% of the miner membership numbers across the targeted five member associations of 1,800 members; and (4) reached 146 decision-makers across the three target countries, 49% of whom are women.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies - World Health Organization 2018</title>
    <description>The Contingency Fund for Emergencies of the World Health Organization (WHO) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  The support of GAC and other donors to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies helps WHO react early to prevent escalation of outbreaks. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to rapidly assess the threat of different outbreaks; and (2) initiating urgent activities to prevent the spread of outbreaks, such as the delivery of vital health supplies, the training of community health workers, and the implementation of vaccination campaign.</description>

    <title>Support to the Immediate Response Account - World Food Programme 2019</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future. With the support of GAC and other donors to the Immediate Response Account, WFP is able to respond swiftly to rapid-onset emergencies and protracted crises by providing much-needed up-front funding, and to avoid major pipeline breaks in life-saving operations. Project activities include: (1) providing food assistance; (2) conducting assessments; (3) supporting local and regional markets; (4) providing supplementary feeding for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and women-headed households; and (5) improving logistical and telecommunications support to transport food on ships, planes, helicopters and trucks, to crisis zones.</description>

    <title>East Africa Drought - Humanitarian Response - UNICEF 2019</title>
    <description>June 2019 - Two years after the 2016-2017 drought brought Somalia and parts of Ethiopia to the brink of famine, severe climatic conditions are again pushing the Horn of Africa towards a major humanitarian emergency. Currently, an estimated 11.4 million people are facing acute food insecurity due to drought or displacement in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda. Without immediate humanitarian action, it is estimated that as many as 17 million people across the region could be acutely food insecure as soon as August.  With support from GAC and other international donors, UNICEF is addressing the varied humanitarian needs of more than 5.4 million vulnerable drought-affected people, including more than 3.2 million children, in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda. Project activities include: (1) providing life-saving nutrition and other medical services; (2) provision of safe water and adequate gender-sensitive sanitation facilities; and (3) child protection interventions, such as psycho-social support and safe spaces for those facing increased risk due to drought-related displacement or other hardships.</description>

    <title>Ebola Crisis in the DRC - Emergency Response - World Health Organization 2019</title>
    <description>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been battling its 10th Ebola outbreak since 1 August 2018 in the conflict-affected provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. This outbreak is now only second in magnitude to the 2014 West Africa outbreak. On July 17, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current Ebola outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”, indicating that the outbreak requires a more robust coordinated international response. In addition, the risk of spread of the virus to neighbouring countries remains very high. The WHO released its Strategic Plan 4 (July to December 2019) outlining its strategy to scale-up the response in order to stop further spread of the disease.  With GAC’s support, WHO’s emergency operations work to help reduce and control the spread of the Ebola virus in the affected regions in the DRC and in surrounding countries. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) strengthening surveillance and follow up on persons identified as having contracted the virus;(3) coordinating and implementing vaccination campaigns; (4) training community health workers; (5) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; and (6) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Severe food shortages and record hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans, and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security and nutrition and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, this project is helping address the basic food needs of up to 9,000 crisis-affected people in Venezuela. Project activities include: (1) providing school meals to vulnerable and at-risk children; (2) distributing family food rations to food-insecure households; and (3) providing agricultural inputs such as seeds and capacity building to increase food production.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Assistance for the Americas - IOM 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Severe food shortages and record hyperinflation have put buying food and medicine out of reach for many Venezuelans and has heavily impacted their ability to meet basic needs. Over 4 million people have fled Venezuela and are now seeking protection in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance including basic health support, food security and nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation assistance.  With GAC’s support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working in several eligible countries in the Americas to help support the response to the Venezuela refugee and migrant situation in the region.  Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter kits, non-food items and multi-purpose cash; (2) coordinating camp management for internally-displaced persons (IDPs) in United Nations bases; (3) deploying mobile teams to remote locations where affected populations lack water, sanitation and hygiene services; (4) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene; (5) supporting humanitarian organizations by establishing lightweight camps in deep field locations, heavy base camps and national NGO support centres, and by providing cargo transport services; (6) data collection that includes mapping of vulnerable populations at points of entry, and at the district and community levels for enhanced targeting and delivery of assistance; and (7) protection and gender mainstreaming across humanitarian response activities for extremely vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied migrant children, and single women and adolescent girls.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - Action Against Hunger 2020-2021</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and 2020 expects additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDPs) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands Congolese refugees.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 68,337 conflict-affected people in the Mweso Health Zone in the DRC. This project focuses on improving water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing access to basic health and sexual and reproductive health and rights services to conflict-affected people.  Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating 65 water points; (2) constructing 500 latrines; (3) providing training to up to 18,870 people in acute and several malnutrition prevention; and (4) providing training to up to 50 community health workers.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - People in Need 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and it is expected that 2020 brings additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDP) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees.  With GAC’s support, People in Need is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 24,524 conflict-affected people in Kabambare territory, DRC. This project focuses on improving water, sanitation and hygiene conditions of health structures (such as hospitals, clinics, health care centers), preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing basic health services to conflict-affected people.  Project activities include: (1) distributing up to 48 medical kits to existing health structures; (2) providing sanitation and hygiene kits to health structures; (3) providing training to over 60 community health volunteers; and (4) distributing food supplements and equipment to help treat severe acute malnutrition.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Water, Hygiene, Health and Livelihoods Assistance - CARE Canada 2020-2021</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Basic service provision is collapsing, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s multi-year support, CARE Canada is providing emergency water, sanitation, hygiene, and reproductive health services, and livelihoods support to up to 43,877 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Taiz and Ibb governorates of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing cash assistance to enable beneficiaries to meet their basic needs; (2) rehabilitating or establishing water sources and latrines in rural communities; (3) providing hygiene and dignity kits; and (4) providing training to community health workers, and providing medical supplies to promote sexual and reproductive health services.</description>

    <title>Yemen - Emergency Health and Nutrition Assistance - ADRA Canada 2020-2021</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Yemen is currently the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy has pushed nearly 10 million people to the brink of famine, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Basic service provision is collapsing, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s multi-year support, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) Canada is providing emergency health and nutrition support to up to 135,000 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, particularly women, in the Marib and Sana’a governorates of Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing health facilities with essential medication and medical supplies; (2) providing health services, including emergency obstetric and newborn care, family planning, and vaccination for children; (3) ensuring access to medical services and psychosocial support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; and (4) screening and providing treatment for acute malnutrition, particularly among children and pregnant and lactating women.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Basic Needs and Protection Response in Jordan - CARE Canada 2020-2021</title>
    <description>January 2020 - With the Syria crisis in its ninth year, Jordan continues to host up to 1.3 million Syrian refugees in camps and host communities, of whom over 650,000 are registered. Additional populations of concern include 58,000 Iraqis, as well as a small number of unregistered refugees, including those from Yemen. Crisis-affected populations require continued assistance to address basic humanitarian and protection needs.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is providing basic needs and protection support to refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. The intervention aims to reach 32,300 individuals.  Project activities include: (1) providing holistic and gender-focused case management to vulnerable populations in the community centres and/or through community outreach; (2) providing psychosocial support (PSS) services, peer support and one-on-one counselling to Syrian and non-Syrian refugees, and host community members, especially women and children; (3) increasing capacity of Women’s Leadership Councils through training, support, and an internship program; and (4) providing emergency cash assistance to the most vulnerable households.</description>

    <title>Integrated Emergency Health, Nutrition, Protection and WASH Response in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide health, protection, and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services to up to 57,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) provision of emergency, gender-responsive health care services; (2) provision of emergency nutrition services for pregnant and lactating women, girls and boys; (3) provision of high quality child protection services and gender-based violence (GBV) services for women, men, girls and boys; and (4) provision of gender-responsive water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services for women, men, girls and boys.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Response Capacities of Deployed Medical Personnel</title>
    <description>This project focuses on addressing the critical gap in the basic medical training of women and men uniformed medical personnel deployed to the top five high-threat UN peacekeeping missions, in order to limit injuries and fatalities of peacekeepers when they occur. This training works to encompass the physical dimensions of Level 1 medical assistance and the psychological dimensions of trauma, potentially reducing the consequences of combat stress reactions and post-traumatic stress disorders, with a particular emphasis on responses to sexual and gender-based violence. Project activities include: (1) conducting a needs assessment in each of the eight countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo); (2) tailoring the training materials to specific gaps identified in the needs assessments; (3) delivering a training of trainers workshop; (4) delivering eight training courses to women and men uniformed medical personnel; and (5) designing and implementing an online platform to provide advice and mentoring to those trained participants.</description>

    <title>Data for Change: Addressing Barriers to Girls’ Education</title>
    <description>This project seeks to improve learning outcomes for girls and adolescent girls in 13 fragile and conflict-affected contexts, and in humanitarian settings. Violence in fragile or conflict-affected contexts and in humanitarian settings prevents girls and adolescent girls from accessing safe quality education. The project aims to use data to better understand the barriers to girls’ and adolescent girls’ education in Côte d’Ivoire, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The project also aims to ensure that national education policies and plans in these countries are informed by the most up-to-date evidence on the barriers to education for girls and adolescent girls.  The project aims to examine the country data from Violence against Children Surveys (VACS). These are national surveys that have been conducted in 20 countries with information for over 10% of the world’s population under the age of 24 on the complex issue of violence, with the goal of informing our policies and programs.  This project also provides additional targeted support to the government of Côte d’Ivoire and governments in the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) to enhance their ability to develop laws, policies and programs to address these barriers.  Project activities include: (1) analyzing existing Violence against Children Surveys (VACS) data with a focus on barriers to girls’ and adolescent girls’ education in 12 fragile or conflict-affected countries (excluding Guatemala which will benefit from knowledge exchange); (2) advocating for increased understanding and use of new data from secondary analyses to maximize data that is already available, by key education actors in government and civil society; (3) developing a new methodology for conducting a VACS in a humanitarian setting to gain an understanding of violence against children in refugee camps/settlements, and also with special attention to girls’ and adolescent girls’ education; and (4) providing technical assistance to develop multi-sectoral and gender-transformative National Action Plans in Côte d’Ivoire, Honduras and El Salvador, to prevent and respond to barriers to education for girls and adolescent girls, especially violence.  The project’s direct beneficiaries include Ministries of Education, of Health, of Women and Children, and of Social Protection among others, in the 13 targeted countries, as well as civil society, non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups working in the field of girls’ education.</description>

    <title>Advancing Women Peace and Security Implementation in South Sudan</title>
    <description>This project aims to support grassroots South Sudanese women’s organizations to support peacebuilding and reconciliation in their communities, through capacity building and providing small grants for their operations. South Sudan is at a critical moment, transitioning from conflict to post-conflict, with a fragile peace process in place. Women have played an essential role in the path to peace. This project works to further support enhancing gender mainstreaming and the integration of women and girls’ rights and experiences in South Sudan’s transitional institutions at the highest levels, through a Gender Advisor to the Special Envoy for the Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD).  Project activities include: (1) providing capacity building to women politicians and women’s organizations to meaningfully engage in the Revitalised Agreement of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS); and (2) ensuring gender-sensitivity of members to the R-ARCSS pre-transitional and transitional institutions, including in areas of protection, leadership and participation.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia - Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – Drought and inter-communal conflict are expected to leave at least 8 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2.9 million people displaced by violence and natural disasters. Internally displaced populations are amongst the most vulnerable in Ethiopia, living in nearly 1,200 informal settlements, often extremely remote and with almost no access to food or basic services. In addition, Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees reliant on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations throughout the year. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 7.5 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.5 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.2 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.4 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.  With GAC’s support, the South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund is providing timely allocations to national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies to meet critical humanitarian needs of people throughout the country. The Fund is managed by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Support to the Fund is helping to achieve its objectives, including: (1) promoting early action and response to reduce loss of life; (2) enhancing response to time-critical humanitarian requirements; and (3) strengthening core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance - ACTED 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) started to deteriorate in 2017. This has continued through late 2019, where a resurgence of direct confrontations between armed actors was observed. This, combined with continued insecurity, led to suspensions of movements of humanitarian actors, impacting the humanitarian response. CAR is one of the most dangerous contexts in the world for humanitarian workers. The crisis in CAR is a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and sexual and gender-based violence cases are common. Approximately 35% of the population is food insecure and only 50% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across the country that is controlled by armed groups continues to exacerbate displacement; currently, over one quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally (600,100) or as refugees in neighbouring countries (592,000).  With GAC’s support, the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 70,000 conflict-affected people in Mbomou and Basse Kotto prefectures, CAR. This project focuses on increasing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in and around health facilities, schools and in communities affected by nutrition. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 5 water points; (2) construction of 475 family latrines; and (3) adapt the water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure in 5 communities to support gender-responsive nutrition responses.</description>

    <title>South Sudan - Emergency Health Care - Doctors Without Borders Canada 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - An estimated 7.5 million people across South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection as a result of armed conflict, food insecurity, malnutrition, economic decline and disease. Approximately 1.5 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and almost 2.2 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. An estimated 6.4 million people are currently severely food insecure, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have strained an already overwhelmed health system.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders Canada is providing emergency health services for up to 164,000 conflict-affected people in Upper Nile and Jonglei states in South Sudan. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, including 32,500 outpatient consultations and vaccinating 30,000 children; (2) providing sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including 5,500 postnatal consultations and 2,600 assisted deliveries; and (3) providing secondary healthcare services, including 4,000 inpatient admissions and treating 900 malnutrition cases with therapeutic feeding.</description>

This, combined with continued insecurity, led to suspensions of movements of humanitarian actors, impacting the humanitarian response. CAR is one of the most dangerous contexts in the world for humanitarian workers. The crisis in CAR is very much a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and SGBV cases commonplace.

GAC and other donors are providing funding to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international NGOs as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. The CHF’s main objectives include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national non-governmental organizations, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Emergency Assistance to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - IOM 2020</title>
    <description>April 2020 - In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on March 25th, 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. The GHRP’s three strategic priorities are: (1) containing the spread of the pandemic; (2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and (3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been monitoring the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, migrants, returnees, and host communities. As part of the GHRP, IOM is responding to new and additional needs, which have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in humanitarian situations, including facilitating access to essential relief items and adequate living conditions for crisis-affected populations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, IOM is providing assistance in multiple sectors, including health, camp coordination and camp management, displacement tracking, protection, shelter, emergency non-food items, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. Project activities include: (1) providing life-saving primary health care and critical medical supplies; (2) providing WASH services in health-care facilities and points of entry; (3) enhancing national capacity for detection; (4) strengthening Community Event-Based Surveillance including by linking mobility information to surveillance data, particularly among border communities to identify high-risk transmission mobility corridors/areas; (5) ensuring the continuation of services, including primary health care and WASH facilities; (6) strengthening the access to social networks and livelihoods for migrants, IDPs, and other vulnerable populations; (7) providing assistance to stranded migrants; (8) strengthening existing protection mechanisms and social services to identify, support and refer people in need of care or protection; and (9) disseminating key messages on service delivery, health and hygiene to migrants, IDPs and other vulnerable populations.</description>

    <title>Empowering Women and Girls in Ethiopia</title>
    <description>The project aims to enhance the well-being of marginalized women and girls in the Afar and Harari regions of Ethiopia. Project activities include: (1) providing training to community leaders and members, including marginalized women and girls, on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), including issues related to gender-based violence (GBV) and harmful traditional practices (child, early, and forced marriage and female genital mutilation); (2) providing training and technical assistance to local health service providers and facilities, including community-based health extension workers and birth attendants, on improving sexual and reproductive health service delivery and on preventing, responding to, and reporting on GBV; (3) creating income generating opportunities for women and youth through training in vocational, financial literacy and business skills, and facilitating their access to markets; and (4) sensitizing community leaders on the barrier to and benefits of women and youth entrepreneurship. The project works with 3,190 pastoralist women and girls, 3,000 disabled women and girls, and mothers of disabled persons, 5,000 men and boys, and 3,190 community leaders and health service personnel.</description>

    <title>Funding Facility for Stabilization in Iraq - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>The project supports the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) COVID-19 response plan in areas of Iraq that are particularly ill-equipped to manage and/or hardest hit by the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, a portion of Canadian funding to the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS) has been reallocated to support UNDP’s COVID-19 response plan.  UNDP’s COVID-19 response plan seeks to: (1) prevent the spread of COVID-19, manage confirmed cases and save lives; (2) strengthen the Government of Iraq’s (GOI) crisis management and response; and (3) support the GOI in designing post-COVID-19 recovery strategies to address the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.  Project activities include: (1) raising community awareness and sharing official/authorized guidance on COVID-19, including key gender messages, through an online platform; (2) equipping three medical labs with priority medical equipment to strengthen testing capacity; (3) equipping ten healthcare facilities with 180 beds and 180 single-patient airborne infection isolation rooms, in addition to medical furniture/equipment and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers; (4) supporting the United Nations Country Team in Iraq to develop a gender-sensitive post-COVID-19 Recovery Strategy; (5) reaching 25,000 people, particularly women and youth, through social cohesion activities; (6) undertaking three gender-sensitive socio-economic needs and impact assessments, including an assessment on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable groups; and (7) identifying gender-sensitive short- and medium-term recovery strategies for Iraq.</description>

    <title>Open Data for Development (OD4D) - Phase 3</title>
    <description>Open data – information from governments and other institutions made accessible to all - is becoming a major driver for social change, innovation and development, contributing to increasing trust in institutions, more transparent and accountable governance, more innovative economies, more effective service delivery and more engaged citizens. Through the Open Data for Development (OD4D) program, Canada supports innovative approaches to help realize the full potential of open data to transform governments, civil society and business, to empower women and girls, and to ensure benefits for citizens in developing countries. OD4D supports a coordinated network of initiatives and institutions around the world whose activities include providing training for civil society and government officials; evaluating the impact of open data; creating regional peer networks; and supporting governments to plan and implement open data policies.  This third phase of OD4D seeks to facilitate the use of data to improve inclusion and gender equality, good governance and economic growth, thus ensuring that open data contributes to achieving the 2030 Agenda. OD4D activities include: (1) exploring how data can drive inclusion, better governance and empowerment, including for women, Indigenous and LGBTQI+ people; (2) supporting research on the impact of data use on development outcomes; (3) enhancing southern perspectives in data governance; and (4) further building OD4D regional hubs’ capacity.</description>

    <title>Rohingya Crisis - Myanmar Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is characterized by a complex combination of vulnerability to armed conflict, inter-communal tension, protracted displacement, and food insecurity. It is estimated that 985,000 crisis-affected people are in need of humanitarian assistance this year, including more than 273,000 displaced people (of which 69% are women and children) who remain in camps or camp-like settings across the country.  This project represents Canada’s funding to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF). The MHF provides timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as United Nations agencies, to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in Myanmar. The MHF’s main objectives include: (1) addressing acute unmet emergency needs; (2) filling the highest priority gaps in protracted crisis situations; (3) preventing a worsening of the situation and increased vulnerability; and (4) responding to new emergencies or sudden-onset disasters.</description>

    <title>Rohingya Crisis - Health, Nutrition, Protection and WASH Assistance in Bangladesh - ACF 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, there are approximately 855,000 Rohingya refugees living in 34 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing comprehensive gender-responsive nutrition, health, protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programming to address lifesaving needs and reduce vulnerability. Project activities include: (1) treating acutely malnourished children, and pregnant and lactating women; (2) providing mental health, psychosocial support and protection information, programs and services; (3) upgrading sanitation facilities with solar lighting, locks and gender-specific signage; (4) providing training and support to women leaders to promote the advancement and protection of women and girls; and (5) conducting information sessions with men and boys on the prevention of gender-based violence and child marriage.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - BRAC 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, there are approximately 855,000 Rohingya refugees living in 34 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, BRAC is providing safe and equitable access to drinking water and sanitation facilities, as well as enhancing knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and protection issues, for Rohingya refugees and host communities in Cox’s Bazar. Project activities include: (1) operating and maintaining water networks; (2) upgrading latrines and bathing facilities to improve safety, particularly for women and girls; (3) delivering an integrated hygiene promotion program; (4) running awareness-raising campaigns on sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender-based violence prevention; and (5) facilitating leadership programs for adolescents and youth.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Health, Nutrition and Protection in Colombia - ACF 2020-2021</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In addition to hosting over 1 million Venezuelans, Colombia continues to suffer from the effects of longstanding violence and armed conflict between armed groups and criminal gangs. Crisis-affected people, including those in host communities, are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is helping address the basic health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection needs of crisis-affected people in the departments of Guajira, Cesar and Norte de Santander in Colombia.

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Assistance for the Rohingya Crisis - CLWR 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is characterized by a complex combination of vulnerability to armed conflict, inter-communal tension, protracted displacement and food insecurity. It is estimated that 985,000 crisis-affected people are in need of humanitarian assistance this year, including more than 273,000 displaced people (of which 69% are women and children) who remain in camps or camp-like settings across the country.  With GAC’s support, Canadian Lutheran World Relief and its local partner, Lutheran World Federation Myanmar, are providing clean drinking water, non-food items and shelter to internally displaced people and host communities in Central Rakhine State, Myanmar. The project is also addressing issues of protection and social cohesion. Project activities include: (1) improving rainwater harvesting ponds and installing hand pumps; (2) distributing non-food items to persons with disabilities, elderly people, children without caregivers and single-headed households; (3) re-constructing longhouses in a safer, more dignified and gender-responsive manner; (4) providing training on leadership and rights-based empowerment to women, adolescent girls and girls; and (5) conducting awareness raising sessions on sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens, and heavily impacting the ability of people to meet basic needs. Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighboring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  With GAC's support, this project is helping address the basic protection, water, sanitation and hygiene, health and nutrition needs of up to 39,000 crisis-affected people in the region, particularly women and children. Project activities include: (1) providing nutritional assistance to crisis-affected people; (2) providing essential maternal and child health care, supplies and equipment to women and children; (3) rehabilitating and constructing water supply and sanitation systems; and (4) providing sexual and reproductive health information and services to local communities.</description>

    <title>Lebanon - Emergency Response to Explosion in Beirut - Canadian Red Cross Society 2020</title>
    <description>August 2020 – A massive explosion occurred in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, a city of 2.4 million people. The explosion took place in the capital city’s port, which is the main point of entry for all Lebanese imports, including food and other basic items. Multiple medical facilities, including several major hospitals, also sustained structural damage and have ceased to be operational. The Government of Lebanon has estimated that more than 300,000 people have lost their homes and 220 people have died. The Lebanese Red Cross is providing emergency medical services and aid distribution in areas most affected by the blast.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross and the Lebanese Red Cross are working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the explosion. Project activities include: (1) providing blood transfusion programming, including the testing and distributing of blood supply to local health centers; (2) scaling up emergency medical services and ambulatory services; and (3) distributing food, hygiene products, and household items to vulnerable people.</description>

    <title>Lebanon - Response to Explosion in Beirut - UNFPA 2020</title>
    <description>August 2020 - In response to new and exacerbated humanitarian needs in Lebanon following the August 4, 2020 explosions at the Port of Beirut, the United Nations launched a flash appeal to respond to the needs of 300,000 people in Lebanon affected by the explosions until November 2020. The appeal outlines a coordinated humanitarian response to the most immediate and lifesaving needs, including provision of essential health care, food, water, hygiene, shelter and protection to people affected by the explosions.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is scaling up its emergency response to provide integrated sexual and reproductive healthcare, including emergency obstetric and neonatal care, gender-based violence (GBV) services that include psychological first aid, psychosocial counselling, mental health services, legal assistance, and case management. Project activities include: (1) ensuring the continuity of life-saving services, including emergency obstetric and neonatal care, and the minimum initial services package for reproductive health in emergencies; (2) procuring medical equipment and supplies for maternity departments and affected health facilities; and (3) providing life-saving GBV services, including psychological first aid, clinical management of sexual violence, and long-term counselling.</description>

    <title>Support to Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund - Emergency Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project works to provide funding to local CSOs in fragile and conflict-affected states, who are actively engaged in delivering key resources and services to address the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 outbreaks have had significant, negative impacts in many countries. These impacts have been amplified in fragile and conflict-affected contexts where conflict drivers are further exacerbated. Local CSOs around the world are playing key roles in supporting efforts to respond to, and stem the spread of COVID-19. Project activities include: (1) persuading populations to follow public health directives; (2) advocating for specific needs for women and girls in response to COVID-19; and (3) supporting women who constitute 70% of the workers and care givers in the health and social sector globally, and are on the frontlines of the response.</description>

    <title>Fiduciary Risk Management for Education in Bangladesh</title>
    <description>The project aims to support improved financial and fiduciary risk management of the Government of Bangladesh’s Primary Education Development Program funds and strengthen the Government’s implementation capacity in primary education.  The Primary Education Development Program’s goal is to provide efficient, inclusive and equitable primary education covering pre-primary through  grade 5 for all school-age girls and boys in Bangladesh. By strengthening the Government’s capacity in public financial management, this project supports the efficient and effective delivery of public education services.  Project activities include: (1) quarterly and annual fiduciary reviews; (2) public financial management (PFM) action plan implementation and capacity development in key PFM areas, including procurement; (3) a benchmarking study of PFM best practices (including gender-budgeting) that can be adopted in different social sectors, including health and skills; and (4) a study on gender disparity in drop-outs and out-of-school children.</description>

    <description>This project aims to address the education needs arising from COVID-19 in Somalia, by providing support to education stakeholders with COVID-19 response plans and gender-responsive remote education programming for girls, particularly girls with disabilities. The project works to ensure that safe spaces for girls are being adapted to remain safely accessible in the context of COVID-19. Project activities include: (1) organizing gender-responsive messaging on COVID-19, sexual and gender-based violence, and girls with disabilities; (2) piloting digital learning solutions for girls with disabilities; (3) providing cash transfers to families to support girls’ return to school; (4) ensuring schools are disability-friendly; and (5) providing gender-responsive teacher training on distance learning, disabilities, COVID-19, and psychosocial support.  This project expects to benefit 22,500 girls, including 7,500 girls with disabilities, 1,248 teachers, 1,092 members of community education committees, and 70 government officials. The project also expects to indirectly benefit 200,000 community members.</description>

    <title>Southern African Nutrition Initiative - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to lessen the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on poor and marginalized communities in targeted areas of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. Aligned with national pandemic response plans, this project works to help reduce the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable people, particularly women and girls, by increasing the capacity of health care centers, health care workers, and communities to prevent and respond to the pandemic. Project activities include: (1) providing training to facility- and community-based health workers to better identify and respond to COVID-19; (2) providing health centers with essential hygiene and sanitation supplies, including locally-procured personal protective equipment; (3) raising awareness about COVID-19 prevention and safe hygiene and sanitation practices among community members; (4) increasing access to essential hygiene and sanitation supplies at the household level; and (5) strengthening community-based sexual and gender-based violence prevention and response mechanisms.  This project expects to directly benefit 59,000 women, girls, men, and boys in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. This project also expects to indirectly benefit an additional 1,075,000 women, men, girls and boys.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - International Rescue Committee 2019-2020</title>
    <description>February 2019 – From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as the Ituri province, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2018 has pushed the limits of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services, has exacerbated life-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt of this context, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict, and where widespread human rights abuses and sexual violence are prevalent. In 2018, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee is providing assistance to help address the urgent needs of up to 125,249 conflict-affected people in territories of Beni and Lubero in the North Kivu province, DRC. This project focuses on improving access to emergency health services, and increasing the safety and protection of conflict-affected women, adolescent girls and girls. Project activities include: (1) procuring up to 6 health facilities and 6 mobile clinics with equipment, vaccines and essential drugs for the treatment of pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea; (2) establishing up to 12 referral systems for emergency cases requiring specialized care; (3) providing training to up to 24 health facility staff members on the use of available supplies, materials, and emergency obstetric care; and (4) distributing up to 3164 dignity kits to girls and women in targeted communities.</description>

    <title>Gender-Inclusive Radio-Based Education in the DRC – Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve learning outcomes for out-of-school children, particularly girls and children with disabilities, in conflict-affected and marginalized communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project builds on a 4-year pilot project implemented by War Child Canada that used interactive radio instruction to reach learners unable to participate in the formal school system. The project aims to scale-up the radio-based education approach to ensure continuity of education for learners affected by school closure, and to support COVID-19 prevention messages. Project activities include: (1) providing training to 100 education assistants and ministry personnel in Interactive Radio Learning  and gender-responsive education; (2) broadcasting of accelerated learning curriculum in three new DRC provinces (Haut Katanga, Ituri and Tanganyika); (3) supporting learners through access to education assistants via toll-free hotline and on-air question and answer period following radio broadcasts; (4) developing and broadcasting of daily radio spots with messaging on health education, gender-based violence and the importance of girls’ education; and (5) providing water, sanitation and hygiene support to identified education structures based on rapid needs assessment to facilitate the back to school campaign.  This project expects that an additional 366,937 (of which 184,569 are girls and 182,368 are boys) crisis-affected learners have access to quality education.</description>

    <title>Supporting Distance Learning in Response to COVID-19 in Sierra Leone and Liberia</title>
    <description>The project aims to support education for marginalized populations in Sierra Leone and Liberia in response to school closures and learning losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project’s innovative approach harnesses proven resources from traditional education programs with proven communication methods used in the agricultural sector through rural radio. Project activities include: (1) developing and distributing family literacy kits, including books and a parent’s lesson plan to households in the target regions; (2) providing up-to-date and evidence-based information about COVID-19 transmission prevention; and (3) developing and transmitting radio programs including gender-responsive and learner-centred content for primary school students and their families.  Project beneficiaries include approximately 70,000 children (50% of whom are girls), approximately 350,000 members of their families (of whom 50% are women), and 2,100 teachers (840F; 1,260M).  The project will indirectly reach up to 637,837 Liberians (of whom 50% are women) and 687,989 Sierra Leoneans (of whom 50% are women) who live in the districts covered by the program and with access to the radio broadcasts.</description>

    <title>Improving Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in Mali - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project builds on a previous project that supported the Malian Red Cross’ efforts towards the Government of Mali’s plans to reduce maternal and child mortality in the regions of Koulikoro and Sikasso. The delivery of health services in times of stability as well as in times of emergency is critical in Mali where there are significant governance and security challenges and where there are low levels of economic and social development. This project is providing additional funds in response to the immediate needs of the COVID-19 pandemic to support the national health system efforts, while safeguarding the provision of critical reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services for women and girls.  Project activities include: (1) training health staff and community health workers in targeted areas of Sikasso to safely and effectively respond to epidemics, especially COVID-19; (2) rehabilitating and/or installing water sanitation and hygiene facilities in targeted health facilities/communities in Sikasso; (3) installing hand washing stations in highly vulnerable communities and high-risk areas such as markets, churches, mosques, borders entry points; (4) providing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) materials and personal protection equipment to health centers/integrated community case management ( iCCM) sites in Sikasso to effectively prevent COVID-19; (5) adapting current communication strategies, including radiobroadcasting messages, to demystify rumours and provide information on prevention, protection and coping practices related to COVID-19; (6) delivering targeted communication for couples, pregnant women, adolescents, the elderly and disabled through household visits and community demonstrations by Red Cross volunteers, community health workers and gender champions accompanied by religious leaders and community health associations; (7) providing adapted psycho-social support to Covid-19 patients and their relatives in Sikasso; (8) training and supervising staff and volunteers on early warning and case detection through contact tracing to strengthen community-based surveillance; and (9) updating the Malian Red Cross Preparedness for Effective Response Assessment to identify and correct gaps and areas that need strengthening, including supporting women’s participation as decision-makers in the response, and support the implementation of prioritized actions, including linking to and operationalization of Malian Red Cross Emergency Operations Centre.  A consortium led by the Canadian Red Cross Society, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and collaboration with the local partner and the Malian Red cross implemented this project.  The activities of the COVID-19 response in the two districts of Sikasso (Sikasso and Kadiolo) will reach a total of 386,526 direct beneficiaries (including 194,848 females) as well as 646,472 indirect beneficiaries (including 325,887 females).</description>

    <title>Providing Home-Grown Nutritious School Meals to Primary School Children</title>
    <description>This project aims to provide nutritious and safe school meals to vulnerable primary school children in Sri Lanka. These meals are locally sourced and sustainable as a result of market linkages with local smallholder farmers, particularly women. Project activities include: (1) providing nutrition-sensitive home-gardening kits and training on climate-smart agriculture and financial management to women farmers; (2) creating market linkages between school meal suppliers and poultry farmers; (3) raising awareness of school principals, teachers and students on gender equality, nutrition and healthy diets; and (4) promoting healthy habits, such as hand washing, in schools. This project expects to directly benefit 1,700 women farmers and 170,000 primary grade school children in 10 districts in the North, East and North Central provinces.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved quality of school meals through local nutrient-dense foods, sourced from small-holder farmers, particularly women, and adherence to food safety standards; (2) increased consumption of nutritious and safe food among girl and boys; and (3) improved engagement of multi-sectoral stakeholders (national and sub-national governments) to scale-up the Home-Grown School Meals modality.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (August 2023) include: (1) provided support to smallholder farmers in 821 micro-farms and 730 poultry farms, by providing key agricultural inputs (including plant seedlings, irrigation equipment, poultry feed) and capacity-building in support of production diversification; (2) developed and implemented a social behaviour change communication campaign towards the promotion and improvement of nutrition practices; (3) provided training on nutrition to principals and school meals programme relevant teachers of 795 schools; (4) promoted food safety practices through the delivery of workshops and trainings for healthy cooking and the provision of food-safe carrier containers to 802 meal suppliers and cooking pots to 96 school kitchens for hygienic food handling; and (5) supported World Food Programme and  a private sector partner to conduct entrepreneur and gender-sensitive household cash management training  for 42 women development officers. This project responded to an emergency created by the re-emergence of COVID-19 where the National School Meal programme was temporarily suspended. 41,121 primary school students received take home food rations to counter any possible negative impact on their nutrition levels, utilizing repurposed funds from the project.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Urgent Rehabilitation Services and Psycho-Social Support in Gaza - Humanity and Inclusion 2018</title>
    <description>July 2018 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, Humanity and Inclusion is helping to address urgent post-operative and rehabilitation care needs in Gaza’s five governorates by providing outreach and center-based multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services for vulnerable Palestinians. These services include wound care, first rehabilitation responses, as well as individualized and collective psychosocial support to persons with injuries and their caretakers. The project also entails the procurement and provision of requisite assistive devices for persons with injuries and the capacity building of outreach teams on trauma management, amputation rehabilitation, burn and wound management and rehabilitation, and psychological first aid, so that they can provide standardized lifesaving care. The project collaborates with various actors and clusters to ensure an inclusive and coordinated response that takes cognizance of the needs of persons with disabilities.  Project activities include: (1) providing multidisciplinary nursing care, rehabilitation and psychosocial services to persons with injuries and caretakers; (2) procuring and distributing specific assistive devices to beneficiaries; (3) referring persons with injuries to service providers to address other specific needs; (4) providing training for caretakers on basic home-based rehabilitation and follow up exercises; and (5) providing training for caregiver facilitators on the provision of peer to peer psychosocial support conducted.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Populations in Need - Development and Peace 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace is helping to increase the resilience of acutely vulnerable families living in substandard housing in Gaza. This project is built on the premise that acutely vulnerable families living in adequate, safe shelters that meet the needs of women, girls, the elderly, and people with disabilities, reduces their vulnerability. Project activities include: (1) providing training to women and men social work and engineer interns in job-related technical skills and soft-skills, protection, and gender-based violence awareness; (2) developing rehabilitation plans that reflect the needs and preferences of all household members, especially women and girls, and incorporate relevant environmentally friendly technologies; (3) ensuring beneficiaries and contractors receive timely payment of relevant rehabilitation tranches; (4) confirming households receive appropriate support throughout the rehabilitation process; and (5) ensuring Gazan households receive timely and appropriate non-food items e-vouchers.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Populations in Need of Food Security and WASH - MA’AN 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the MA’AN Development Centre (MA’AN) is helping to improve the resilience and food security of agricultural households in the West Bank, including agriculture-dependent women-headed households. This project is also helping to increase safe, equitable and sustainable access to water for drinking, cooking, personal and domestic hygiene, and to improve access to adequate sanitation in Gaza. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating under-cultivated or damaged land, including constructing retaining walls and protection fences, providing seedlings and grains, and rehabilitating farm water harvesting cisterns; (2) conducting training workshops on crop management and livestock feeding and disease control to build technical capacities of vulnerable agricultural households to manage natural and manmade shocks to their livelihoods; (3) rehabilitating eight kilometers of agricultural roads to expand access to shrinking agricultural lands; (4) rehabilitating community water wells to increase rainwater harvesting for agricultural uses; (5) installing renewable energy/solar systems in public desalination plants and providing spare parts and supplies to support their operation; and (6) providing case management and referral services for vulnerable women who are survivors or are at risk of gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Addressing the Education Needs of Internally Displaced Children during COVID-19 and Beyond</title>
    <description>This project aims to support the continuity of pre-primary and primary education for internally displaced girls and boys in the Oromia and Somali regions of Ethiopia. This project addresses the gender-based barriers preventing access to education within internally displaced persons (IDPs) communities, caregivers and families. This project also aims to improve gender-responsive, safe and quality education through schools and distance education. Project activities include: (1) providing training to teachers and students on gender and age-responsive coronavirus (COVID-19) precaution measures; (2) providing equipment and supplies (for example, personal protective equipment and dignity kits) to schools; (3) establishing and strengthening community-based gender and age-responsive girls’ clubs; (4) providing girls and boys with gender and age-responsive distance education materials; and (5) providing training to pre-primary children caregivers on supporting reading and math at home.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Protection and SRHR Response in Jordan - IRC 2020</title>
    <description>January 2020 - With the Syria crisis in its ninth year, Jordan continues to host up to 1.3 million Syrian refugees in camps and host communities, of whom over 650,000 are registered. Additional populations of concern include 58,000 Iraqis, as well as a small number of unregistered refugees, including those from Yemen. Crisis-affected populations require continued assistance to address basic humanitarian and protection needs.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is providing protection services and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) support to refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (3) providing training to women community leadership groups; (4) conducting engagement sessions with men and boys on SGBV and harmful social norms; and (5) developing technical support plans with and for identified local actors.</description>

    <title>Improving Health and Protection Outcomes of Women and Girls During COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the health and protection of women and girls during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, by addressing their heightened vulnerabilities to maternal mortality, unplanned pregnancies, and online sexual exploitation and abuse. This project has two components:  Component one works to support local governments in continuing the provision of sexual and reproductive health services, as well as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), in communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Project activities include: (1) providing COVID-19 protection information, family planning counselling and services, through mobile and online platforms; (2) providing technical assistance and support in the roll out of cash assistance program for maternal health services; and (3) providing training to midwives and other healthcare workers on MHPSS services.  Component two focuses on building the capacity of government and civil society organizations to prevent and respond to online facilitated sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). Project activities include: (1) creating a database and profiling system for early detection and reporting of cases; (2) organizing an online support group to provide survivors with access to legal, health, and psychosocial support services; and (3) engaging youth organizations in developing solutions that tackles online sexual exploitation and abuse.  The project expects to provide 5,000 pregnant women with cash assistance to access institution-based health services, and 4,100 people (of which 97% are women) with contraceptives. The project expects that 300,000 individuals receive COVID-19 protection information and family planning counselling. The project also expects to provide 200 healthcare workers with training on MHPSS, and at least 1,000 survivors with SGBV support services.</description>

    <title>Towards a Landmine-Free Sri Lanka: The HALO Trust</title>
    <description>This project aims to clear approximately 359,000 square meters of landmine-affected areas in northern Sri-Lanka, in order to allow resettlement and increased security of vulnerable and displaced populations.  Project activities include: 1) clearing landmines from residential areas; 2) repairing infrastructure, such as a water reservoirs and irrigation systems; 3) gender-sensitive employment practices used by the project partner, HALO Trust, including promoting women to supervisory positions in an equitable manner.  Approximately 13,900 people (of which 52% are women and girls) are expected to benefit from the project in the short-term, including over 3,750 long-term internally displaced people who are expected to have increased access to their home areas in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts in northern Sri Lanka.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of the project include: 1) increased access to resettlement by internally displaced, landmine-affected people in Sri Lanka; 2) increased access to public services by landmine-affected people in Sri Lanka; and 3) increased access to livelihoods opportunities for landmine-affected women and men in Sri Lanka, particularly for women.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Result achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) includes: cleared about 316,065m2 of land within Kilinochchi, Jaffna, and Mullaitivu Districts in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The clearance teams found and safely destroyed 3,079 items of explosive ordnance. This project enabled the release of 389,900m2 of land back to landowners and local communities. The release of land previously contaminated with explosive ordnance provided new livelihood opportunities and improved incomes and agricultural potential. They increased the economic resilience of conflict-affected communities. Overall, the project directly benefited 8,069 women, men, girls, and boys, and indirectly impacted 18,441 people.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Resilient, Inclusive, and Safe Education for Children</title>
    <description>This project contributes to children enjoying their right to quality education during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, by facilitating education continuity for vulnerable girls and boys between the ages of 6 and 12. This project also supports learning for deprived out-of-school girls and boys living in care institutions. Project activities include: (1) increasing access to resources by distributing learning materials and gadgets, as well as establishing community-based learning corners; (2) developing a gender-equitable parenting program that tackles the role of fathers in caregiving, women’s decision making, and violence prevention; (3) providing training to teachers and school heads on gender-responsive technical products and learning materials to strengthen their capacity to deliver quality distance-based education; (4) piloting a home-based assessment with the Department of Education to monitor children’s learning and well-being; and (5) establishing communication platforms for meaningful household-school-community engagement. This project expects to benefit 51,595 children, parents/caregivers, school administrators/teachers and local government officials, of which 24,848 are girls and 2,360 are women.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - Doctors of the World 2021</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by violent conflict, epidemics and natural disasters compounding and exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. In 2021, 19.6 million people (20% increase since 2020) are in need of humanitarian assistance. Some 21.8 million people currently face severe acute food insecurity, including 3.4 million acutely malnourished children under the age of five, the highest absolute number ever recorded worldwide. The DRC is also home to the largest internally displaced persons population in Africa with 5.2 million displaced people, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. These needs are exacerbated by communicable disease outbreaks, intensified conflicts, and severe food insecurity.  Project activities include: (1) providing at least 3,810 infants and pregnant and lactating women with moderate and severe acute malnutrition treatments; (2) providing at least 2,010 households with malnutrition screening tools; (3) providing at least 40,200 SRH consultations; and (4) providing at least 12,186 women and girls access to SRH services.  With GAC’s support, Doctors of the World is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 50,250 conflict-affected people. This project focuses on preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing access to primary healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), for conflict-affected people.</description>

    <title>Animating Change: 1001 Nights</title>
    <description>This project seeks to implement the 1001 Nights Civic and Peace Education Program to support the learning continuity of children in grades four to six during the coronavirus pandemic, while promoting peace and stability in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The 1001 Nights Program is a multi-platform educational entertainment program, that uses cartoons to teach children between the ages of 6 and 12 life skills and civic values, including non-violence, human rights, democracy and gender equality, in formal and informal learning environments. By increasing children’s understanding of civic values, this project aims to reduce the vulnerability of children in the BARMM to the drivers of instability. Project activities include: (1) translating and dubbing of the 1001 Nights episodes and materials into three local languages; (2) providing equipment and materials, including teaching guides and lesson plans, to the BARMM’s Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE); (3) providing training to the MBHTE and its teachers on methodologies to teach peace and civic education; (4) broadcasting the 1001 Nights episodes in television and radio; and (5) implementing the curriculum for in-class and distance learning by the MBHTE, with support from parents/caregivers.  This project expects to target 50,000 children (of which 30,000 are girls) and 1,500 teachers (of which 1,000 are women) in 100 schools in the BARMM as well as 5,000 parents/caregivers (of which 3,000 are women).</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved provision of distance-based peace and civic education that normalize inclusivity and gender equality by the MBHTE and parents/caregivers in the BARMM; and (2) improved behavior of children in the BARMM in deconstructing and countering drivers of social instability.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (June 2022) include: (1) provided 50,000 children with 1001 Nights student activity books, storybooks, and comic books; (2) 21,690 children participated in the school-based formal implementation of the 1001 Nights curriculum; (3) of the 500 children tested post-implementation, there was a 44% reduction in the number of children with negative civic values. This includes a decrease in tolerance of different opinions, and a 46% reduction in the number of children with perceptions of gender inequality; (4) trained 209 master trainers (129 women) and 1,660 teachers (1,575 women) across 422 schools on the distance-based delivery of the 1001 Nights curriculum and education that promote gender equality and inclusion; (5) trained 2,920 parents/caregivers on the expected learning outcomes of 1001 Nights and ways to promote children’s home-based learning; and (6) by the end of the project, there was a 116% increase in parents with a  positive understanding of gender equality. For example, holding dual successful roles at home and in leadership positions and a 31% increase in understanding the harm of social exclusion. For example, treating another child differently based on religion or residency status.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Protection in the North-West and South-West Regions - Plan Canada 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 -  Cameroon is experiencing three distinct humanitarian crises in 2021 that include: (1) violence in northeastern Nigeria, cross-border raids and suicide attacks have caused massive displacements in the Far North region; (2) conflict and insecurity in the Central African Republic continue to cause an influx of refugees east of the country; and (3) insecurity in the North-West and South-West regions has led to massive internal displacement. In 2021, at least 4 million people in Cameroon would require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic survival and protection needs exacerbated by the  coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negative impact. With GAC's support, Plan Canada is addressing the urgent child protection and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) needs of 20,380 internally displaced people and other conflict-affected people in the North West and South West regions. Project activities include: (1) establishing equipped safe Child and Adolescent-Friendly Spaces with gender-responsive and accessible improved latrines, handwashing facilities and water supply; (2) providing comprehensive age- and gender-responsive and inclusive case management support services; (3) delivering family tracing and reunification support to unaccompanied and separated children; (4) distributing in-kind safety kits to at-risk adolescent girls, young women and SGBV survivors; and (5) conducting community awareness campaigns on COVID-19 prevention, hygiene promotion and menstrual hygiene management.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Nuclear Security in the Middle East</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the capabilities of state security and law enforcement agencies in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, for planning and carrying out intelligence operations to prevent attempts to traffic nuclear or radiological materials. Project activities include: (1) assessing capabilities, needs and gaps in each country; (2) developing a train-the-trainer cadre of national trainers; (3) facilitating the delivery of nationally-tailored training in each country, delivered by national experts, and with a strong focus on intelligence operations, and how to strike balance between regional information sharing and the protection of sensitive information; (4) organizing and facilitating peer-to-peer workshops to exchange best practices and lessons learned from actual radiological/nuclear trafficking cases; and (5) organizing and delivering a regional tabletop exercise focusing on a scenario involving the trafficking of radioactive material through multiple countries.</description>

    <title>Myanmar - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - Canadian Lutheran World Relief 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 – A complex combination of vulnerability to armed conflict, inter-communal tension, protracted displacement, and food insecurity characterizes the humanitarian situation in Myanmar. An estimated one million crisis-affected people require humanitarian assistance this year, including more than 336,000 displaced people across the country. Humanitarian organizations operate in an increasingly complex environment, including as a result of the recent military coup.  With GAC’s support, Canadian Lutheran World Relief and its local partner, Lutheran World Federation Myanmar, improve access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities, non-food items and shelter for internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities in central Rakhine State, Myanmar. This project also addresses protection and social cohesion issues.

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - BRAC 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, an estimated 855,000 Rohingya refugees live in 34 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx resulted in significant humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, BRAC provides essential primary healthcare services to Rohingya refugees, focusing on increasing health-seeking behaviour and improving care for women. Project activities include: (1) upgrading and equipping healthcare facilities; (2) providing outpatient care such as medical consultations, immunizations for children, and medication; (3) offering sexual and reproductive health services, medical support and referrals for sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) cases, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS); (4) training health service providers in sexual and reproductive health and rights, SGBV, MHPSS and adolescent health; and (5) providing training to community health volunteers doing outreach in the refugee camps.</description>

    <title>Accelerator for Women Climate Entrepreneurs</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystems for women entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa so that they can play a transformative role in the transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient communities. The project will conduct consultations with women climate entrepreneurs, policymakers, intermediaries (such as incubators and accelerators) and investors in East, West and Southern Africa to better understand the barriers faced by women climate entrepreneurs in starting or growing their businesses. The evidence gathered from these consultations will be used to inform and pilot incubation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa. Good practices in climate-focused gender lens investing will be identified and shared, and a road map for international development stakeholders will be developed to provide further gender-responsive support to women climate entrepreneurs and intermediaries.</description>

    <title>République centrafricaine - Assistance d’urgence - ACF – 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) started to deteriorate at an alarming rate in 2017. This trend continued through 2018, which saw a spike in attacks against peacekeepers and civilians alike, mass looting, widespread banditry, and territorial conflicts between armed groups. The crisis in CAR is in essence a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and SGBV cases commonplace. Approximately 40% of the population is food insecure and only 54% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across the 80% of the country that is controlled by armed groups continues to exacerbate displacement; currently, one quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally or as refugees in neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 38,450 conflict-affected people in Basse-Kotto prefecture, CAR. This project focuses on improving access to clean water, preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing basic reproductive health services to displaced women. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to 12 water points; (2) providing sexual and reproductive health services to up to 877 women and girls; and (3) screening and/or treating up to 1,184 children suffering from severe or moderate acute malnutrition.</description>

GAC and other donors are providing funding to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Central African Republic Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This Fund provides timely allocations to national and international NGOs as well as UN agencies to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in CAR. Project activities include: (1) supporting timely responses to sudden crises and critical gaps in humanitarian operations; (2) supporting the transportation of humanitarian supplies and personnel as well as improved communications and storage capacity; and (3) capacity-building for national non-governmental organizations, equipping them with strengthened financial and management tools to implement humanitarian responses.</description>

    <title>Greening the Global Financial System</title>
    <description>This project aims to ensure private finance accounts for the risks and opportunities of climate change, emphasizing the poorest and most vulnerable needs and priorities.  Project activities include: (1) leveraging the United Nations (UN) platform to build international support for the strategy of the UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance; (2) shaping the international narrative of private finance towards the need for every financial decision to take climate change into account; (3) working with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), UN entities, and permanent missions to develop a clear understanding of the barriers to low-carbon, climate resilient investment in developing countries; (4) working with MDBs, UN entities, and the Conference of Parties (COP) Presidency on a common approach to aligning financial flows with the Paris Agreement; (5) working with UN entities, governments, the private sector, and civil society to deliver on the mandate of the high-level event on Financing for Development in the era of COVID-19 and beyond; and (6) identifying solutions and strengthening commitments to mobilize climate finance, particularly for those interventions that reduce poverty and inequalities, with an emphasis on gender-based inequalities.  Direct beneficiaries of this project include UN member states, stakeholders in the financial sector, MDBs and UN agencies and departments. The Special Envoy’s focus on these influential actors helps reorient public and private capital flows to mainstream climate action, address gender inequalities and respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, there are many indirect beneficiaries from this initiative, particularly women and girls.</description>

    <title>Lebanon - Response to Explosion in Beirut - UNHCR 2020</title>
    <description>August 2020 - In response to the explosions in Beirut on August 4th, the United Nations launched a flash appeal on August 14th, 2020. The flash appeal seeks to respond to the significant immediate humanitarian consequences of the explosions. The appeal works to prioritize life-saving responses and protection. These activities continue alongside the pre-existing humanitarian response for the Lebanese and non-Lebanese population, including Syrian and Palestinian refugees .  With the support of GAC and other donors, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern. The UNHCR’s response focuses on addressing pressing shelter and protection needs of the most vulnerable persons affected by the blast, while paving the way for their recovery and rehabilitation in the medium term. The response adopts a whole-population approach, targeting the most affected and most vulnerable households and individuals, including Lebanese, refugees and migrant workers in Beirut, and those displaced outside the city.  Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; and (2) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, and for children.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected People in North-East Nigeria - CARE 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Nearly twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation, or healthcare and widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, an estimated 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, CARE is improving access to healthcare, particularly sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, and protection for conflict-affected internally displaced persons and host communities in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health facilities, with a focus on SRHR; (2) providing case-management and other services to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) or those at risk; and (3) engagement with community stakeholders to improve understanding of and response to protection risks.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected People in Nigeria - Save the Children 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Nearly twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation, or healthcare and widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, an estimated 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children is preventing and treating acute malnutrition and improving access to protection services for conflict-affected internally displaced persons and host communities in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; (2) providing case-management and other services to survivors of sexual and gender based-violence (SGBV) or those at risk; and (3) engaging with community stakeholders to improve understanding of and response to protection risks.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People and Returnees in Somalia - CARE 2021-2022</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Despite progress towards sustainable political stability, the impact of more than three decades of insecurity, exacerbated by frequently recurring drought, increasing seasonal flooding, an ongoing historic infestation of desert locusts, and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, has left much of the population without access to basic services and ever more vulnerable to the next shock. Internal displacement remains at record levels, with an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) living in more than 2,400 sites across the country, and severe food insecurity is projected to increase in 2021, as a La Niña weather event is expected to bring renewed drought conditions early in the year. Altogether, an estimated 5.9 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, CARE is improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services and helping households meet essential needs amongst internally displaced persons, returnees, and host communities in Somalia’s drought- and conflict-affected Lower Juba region. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water points and distributing water and sanitation related non-food items in IDP communities; and (2) providing unconditional cash grants to vulnerable IDP, returnee, and host community households.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Refugees in Uganda - CARE 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 – Uganda currently hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, and the fourth largest in the world, more than 1.4 million people, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of these live in settlements in Uganda’s remote northern and western regions, relying on humanitarian assistance to meet their essential needs. Protection is a particular concern, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated inequities related to gender, age, and other factors already felt within the displaced population.  With GAC’s support, CARE is working to reduce vulnerability to and address the impacts of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amongst women and girls in South Sudanese and Congolese refugee and host communities in Uganda. Project activities include: (1) working with local stakeholders to improve reporting and response mechanisms for SGBV and other protection concerns; (2) providing training and support to local health facilities; and (3) providing case-management and other support for survivors of SGBV.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People in Ethiopia - Save the Children 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Prior to the outbreak of conflict in the Tigray region in late 2020, Ethiopia was already facing ongoing acute humanitarian need, arising from sporadic but widespread intercommunal conflict, regional drought and flooding, swarms of desert locusts, the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of hosting nearly 800,000 refugees throughout the country. Together, these crises have led to widespread food insecurity, high levels of acute malnutrition, and significant population displacement. Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children is preventing and treating acute malnutrition, improving access to healthcare, and increasing the availability of safe water and sanitation amongst drought- and conflict-affected internally displaced persons (IDP) and host communities in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health facilities; (2) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; and (3) rehabilitating or constructing water points and sanitation facilities at health centres and in IDP settlements.</description>

    <title>Burkina Faso - Protection and SRHR Support - CARE 2021-2022</title>
    <description>March 2021 - An estimated 3.5 million people are in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in Burkina Faso. The upsurge in violence over the last two years has forced more than one million people to flee their homes, many of whom have been displaced several times. Hundreds of health facilities are operating at a minimum service due to the insecurity.  With GAC’s support, CARE Canada is providing emergency protection and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) assistance to 38,400 people affected by conflict and displacement. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support to protection committees to build community capacity for identifying and referring survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), particularly women and girls, to available services and resources; (2) providing cash and/or hygiene items to particularly vulnerable households, including women-headed households; (3) organizing community mobilisation/sensitisation on GBV prevention targeting men and boys; and (4) increasing community awareness on SRHR and services.</description>

    <title>Emergency support to WFP  - Sub-Saharan</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The Grand Sud region of Madagascar faces a severe food security and nutrition crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation by driving up the price of essential products and restricting inter-regional travel negatively impacting livelihoods and reducing overall household income. An estimated 1.14 million people in the Grand Sud region and 203,453 people in the Southeast of the country require humanitarian assistance from January to April 2021.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the World Food Programme (WFP) provides additional food assistance to more than 891,000 crisis-affected people until June 2021, the end of the lean season. Project activities include: (1) distributing emergency food assistance through cash-based transfers; (2) treating moderate and acute malnutrition for children under the age of five, including pregnant and lactating women; (3) launching emergency school feeding programs in the country.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People in Ethiopia - CARE 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Prior to the outbreak of conflict in the Tigray region in late 2020, Ethiopia was already facing ongoing acute humanitarian need, arising from sporadic but widespread intercommunal conflict, regional drought and flooding, swarms of desert locusts, the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of hosting nearly 800,000 refugees throughout the country. Together, these crises have led to widespread food insecurity, high levels of acute malnutrition, and significant population displacement. Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, CARE is preventing and treating acute malnutrition, improving access to safe water and sanitation, and helping households to meet essential needs amongst internally displaced persons and host communities in Ethiopia’s drought- and conflict-affected Somali region. Project activities include: (1) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; (2) rehabilitating water points and distributing sanitation and hygiene related non-food items; and, (3) providing unconditional cash grants to crisis-affected households.</description>

Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Concern is identifying and treating acute malnutrition amongst under-five children and pregnant and lactating women in the South Sudanese refugee population living in Ethiopia’s Gambella region. Project activities include: (1) conducting ongoing surveillance to identify acute malnutrition; (2) providing supplementary and therapeutic feeding to treat acute malnutrition; and, (3) providing training and support to improve dietary diversity amongst South Sudanese refugees in Gambella.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Protection and SRHR Response in Jordan - IRC 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - With the Syria crisis in its tenth year, Jordan continues to host an estimated 1.2 million Syrian refugees in camps and host communities, of which over 660,000 registered. Other affected populations include 58,000 Iraqis, including a small number of unregistered refugees and those from Yemen. Crisis-affected populations require continued assistance to address essential humanitarian and protection needs.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection services and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) support to refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (3) providing training to women community leadership groups; (4) conducting engagement sessions with men and boys on SGBV and harmful social norms; and (5) developing technical support plans with and for identified local actors.</description>

    <title>Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the state of coastal resilience for vulnerable populations, particularly women and girls in small island developing states (SIDS) and coastal developing countries, where the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance’s (ORRAA) financial products and projects apply. The aim of ORRAA is to foster collaboration amongst the finance and insurance sectors, governments and environmental organizations.  Project activities include: (1) delivering ORRAA Innovation Challenge workshops to identify new products and projects; (2) developing a technical analysis on the incorporation of gender considerations into ocean risk projects; and (3) presenting policy recommendations on the mitigation of ocean risks for the most vulnerable communities at international forums.  This project benefits the most vulnerable communities, particularly women and girls, in coastal developing countries, SIDS, and other low-lying areas.</description>

    <title>Support to Elections in Sierra Leone</title>
    <description>This project supports two multi-donor funds administered by the UNDP in Sierra Leone: 1) the Conflict Prevention and Mitigation (CPM) fund; and 2) the Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund. Both funds seek to expand levels of electoral and democratic awareness and participation of women and girls, and prevent sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). On March 7, 2018, Sierra Leone is conducting local, legislative and presidential elections. These are the fourth elections since its decade-long civil war ended and the first conducted without the presence of a UN Observer Mission.  The CPM fund is intended to contribute to a peaceful and secure environment during the 2018 election processes through preventive and mitigation activities, including enhanced national dialogue, peace advocacy, and peaceful response capacities, as well as sustained public security, civil protection, human rights promotion, and peaceful response capacities.  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) of Sierra Leone successfully managed the administration of peaceful elections in 2007 and 2012, with declining levels of international involvement in the management of each election. While Sierra Leone has made progress in strengthening the electoral process, NEC requires further support. The SNEC fund aims to complement Government of Sierra Leone resources with technical and material support to the NEC to further their work on meeting their responsibilities for key 2018 electoral processes.</description>

    <expectedResults>In partnership with other donors, Canada contributes to the following expected outcomes: 1) the Conflict Prevention and Mitigation fund: i) enhanced national dialogue, peace, advocacy, and violence prevention; and ii) sustained public security, civil protection, human rights promotion, and peaceful response capacities.  2) the Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund: 1) strengthened capacity to administer technically sound, credible, inclusive and sustainable elections; and 2) improved confidence and participation in the electoral process.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved by the UNDP through the support of the Government of Canada and other international donors in 2017-2018 includes:  The Conflict Prevention and Mitigation fund: 1) nationwide peace advocacy campaigns created awareness among the public on peaceful election processes, political tolerance and the need for citizens to participate in democratic elections; 2) during the run-up to the March 2018 elections, a peace pledge was signed by 18 presidential candidates committing them and their supporters to peaceful conduct of campaigns, elections and acceptance of results; 3) through supporting human rights work, the project helped justice institutions (such as courts and tribunals) address electoral disputes by fast-tracking and resolving over 405 cases through Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms.  The Support to the National Electoral Commission (SNEC) fund: 1) the presidential, parliamentary and local government elections of 2018 were held in a timely and credible manner; 2) a peaceful transition from one legitimately elected government to another was achieved; 3) the NEC’s planning and management capacity was strengthened; and 4) the NEC conducted inclusive elections which were commended by electoral observation missions.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria Crisis – Emergency Protection in Lebanon – IRC 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Lebanon is facing multiple compounding crises in 2021, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic decline and political fragility, the impact of the August 2020 Beirut Port explosions, and the ongoing refugee crisis. With the Syria crisis in its tenth year, Lebanon continues to host over an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide. As the protection environment continues to devolve and needs outpace available international assistance, over 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon live below the poverty line.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection services to refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (3) training women community leadership groups; and (4) conduction engagement sessions with men and boys on SGBV and harmful social norms.</description>

    <title>Support and Sustainability for Gender in Conventional Arms Control</title>
    <description>This project aims to facilitate more inclusive and stable societies through gender-responsive approaches to conventional arms control policy and programming. Project activities include: (1) hosting two conferences centred on increasing the participation of women in conventional disarmament and arms control (including in the development and implementation of effective arms control instruments); (2) developing a handbook for policymakers and diplomats working on integrating a gender perspective into the arms control agenda; and (3) establishing three databases with updated information on lethal violence, transparency in conventional arms trade, and unplanned explosions at munition sites, and making the databases available to arms control policymakers and project or program planners and implementers worldwide.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Assistance in Mbomou - ACTED 2019</title>
    <description>February 2019 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the Central African Republic (CAR) situation started to deteriorate at an alarming rate in 2017. This trend continued through 2018, which saw a spike in attacks against peacekeepers and civilians, mass looting, widespread banditry, and territorial conflicts between armed groups. The crisis in CAR is, in essence, a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV cases) commonplace. Approximately 40% of the population is food insecure, and only 54% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across 80% of the country that armed groups control continues to exacerbate displacement. One-quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally or as refugees in neighbouring countries.  With GAC's support, the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) provides assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 45,125 conflict-affected people in Mbomou prefecture, CAR. This project focuses on nutrition and increasing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in and around health and nutrition facilities. Project activities include: (1) constructing or rehabilitating up to seven water points; (2) training 50 health professionals on identifying and treating children suffering from severe acute malnutrition; and (3) adapting water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure in seven communities to support gender-responsive nutrition responses.</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Jordan – Assistance to Refugees - OCHA CBPF - 2020</title>
    <description>June 2020 - As the conflict in Syria continues to place millions of people in dire humanitarian need, Jordan hosts up to 1.3 million Syrians in camps and host communities, of whom over 650,000 are registered. Additional populations of concern include 58,000 Iraqis and a small number of unregistered refugees, such as those from Yemen. Canada is working with experienced humanitarian partners to meet the emergency needs of the crisis-affected. This funding enables the provision of essential protection, health, food, and basic needs support to vulnerable people, focusing on women, girls and youth.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages the Jordan Humanitarian Fund, which is a country-based pooled fund (CBPF) that allocates resources to national and international humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of crisis-affected populations throughout Jordan. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving and life-sustaining activities while filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance per  humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination and leadership primarily through the Humanitarian Coordinator function, and by leveraging the humanitarian cluster system; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of assistance in hard-to-reach areas by partnering with national and international partners.</description>

    <title>Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka through mine clearance and reintegration of a vulnerable workforce</title>
    <description>Explosive remnants of war remain in the northeast region of Sri Lanka and impact vulnerable and marginalized groups. This project uses an integrated mine action response to release land to communities. It uses vocational training to increase the capacity of de-miners at the end of the project. Both activities aim to decrease social tensions and divides by transitioning and integrating the most marginalized into the workforce.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) safer access to land and sustainable livelihood opportunities for Sri Lankans in the Northern Province and Eastern Province, to enable a peaceful society; and (2) enhanced gender-responsive readiness of the demining workforce to transition from demining to self-employment or wage employment opportunities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2022 include: (1) 175 staff (59 women and 116 men) took a 12-hour Financial Literacy Training course. Given the pilot intervention's success, similar activities will be rolled out during the next quarter and extended to other districts; (2) the project has a gender-responsive orientation programme on market-driven economic opportunities for staff to learn more about the labour market as they transition. This component is integrated into the project as of January 2023, from de-mining work into other formal income-generating activities. To date, 64 staff (24 women and 40 men) have taken the orientation; and (3) progress made in clearing includes 55,560 square metres land released; 38,960 square metres land cleared and 16,600 square metres and reduced. Mines Advisory Group is on track to clear a total of 148,800 suare metres of land.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Supporting Feminist Transformative Peace and Democracy in Sudan</title>
    <description>This project aims to support Sudan’s transition to a civilian-led, democratic, gender-equal state by addressing Sudan’s discriminatory legacy against women. This project contributes to legal reform, raises awareness on women's rights, provides support for women’s political participation, and trains youth on human rights and feminism to sustain reforms in the future. Inter Pares works collaboratively with local counterparts to deepen women’s political power in Sudan through engagement with transitional political structures and foster an environment that supports women’s inclusion and addresses the root causes of misogyny and patriarchy in Sudan. Project activities include advocacy, capacity-building and relationship-building.</description>

    <title>Promoting social cohesion, peaceful seasonal cattle movements and trade in Abyei</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen community-led peacebuilding and conflict resolution mechanisms within the Abyei Administrative Area (AAA). The project focuses on improving the functioning of the Community Court, the Community Peace Committee and the Amiet market. The project also facilitates the peaceful seasonal movement of cattle through the cattle corridors. This improves inter-community relations, trade and livelihoods for herders, traders and the settled population and reduces the potential for violent conflict. Project activities include: (1) training Community Court judges and women councillors on the management of cases involving sexual and gender-based violence, prostitution and juvenile crime; (2) training Amiet Market stakeholders on safe inter-community trade practices; (3) establishing women and youth Community Court subcommittees; (4) training a network of mediators to respond to low-intensity disputes and to signal escalating tensions to the Community Peace Committee; and (5) facilitating peace conferences between Misseriya herders and Ngok Dinka farmers, ensuring  the timing of seasonal movements through Abyei’s cattle corridors is agreed .  Disputes in Abyei are often inter-communal in nature arising between Abeyi’s two predominant ethnic groupings, the Ngok Dinka and the Misseriya. As a contested area between Sudan and South Sudan, the AAA lacks state-run institutions. Abeyi’s community-led peace infrastructure consists of the Community Peace Committee, the Community Court and the Amiet Market. Each of these entities supports inter-communal relations..  There is an ethnic balance in the composition of the peace committee. The market brings together people from across the area.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict-Affected People in North-East Nigeria - IRC 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Nearly twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation, or healthcare and widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, an estimated 8.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, IRC is improving access to healthcare, including therapeutic treatment for acute malnutrition, and safe water and sanitation amongst conflict-affected internally displaced persons and host communities in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health facilities; (2) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; and (3) rehabilitation or establishment of water points and sanitation facilities in targeted communities.</description>

    <title>Typhoon Rai - Emergency Response - IOM 2021</title>
    <description>December 2021 – Super Typhoon Rai, locally known as Odette, made landfall in the southern Philippines on December 16, bringing torrential rains, violent winds and storm surges. Reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. It is estimated that 2.4 million people are in need as a result of the impacts of the typhoon overall, including more than 144,000 displaced people. Over 1.7 million homes have been damaged by the storm and 10.2 million hectares of agricultural land have been affected.  With GAC’s support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the typhoon. Project activities include: (1) provision of emergency shelter materials such as shelter kits, tarpaulins and essential household items; (2) provision of complementary technical assistance to support safe housing repair; and (3) allocation of conditional cash and voucher assistance to displaced families.</description>

    <title>Family Planning Response in Nigeria</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the health of Nigerian women and girls by supporting the National Contraceptives Basket Fund managed by the United Nations Population Fund. The project seeks to increase the quantities of quality contraceptives procured and distributed, and improve the efficient management of the national contraceptive supplies and logistical management system. This helps more contraceptives reach their final service delivery points where they can be accessed by women and girls. Project  activities include: (1) procuring approximately one million contraceptives for women including female condoms and short and long term hormonal contraceptives; (2) conducting state-specific supply chain assessments and performance reviews to ensure family planning commodities reach all health facilities; (3) conducting state-specific inventories of family planning commodities and strengthening the capacity of state health management coordination platforms to avoid running out-of-stock of family planning commodities; (4) planning the distribution of state-specific commodities; (5) developing data placemats and data analysis for performance review; and (6) supporting supervision of the last stage of the distribution of commodities within states.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcome for this project is increased access to and use of family planning methods by young and adult Nigerian women in all their diversity. The project expects to benefit all 36 states by procuring approximately one million contraceptives. It also expects to strengthen supply chain logistics, support the final distribution of contraceptives to communities in 17 states through training 556 health workers (80% of whom are women) and reduce the percentage of service delivery points that report running out of stock of family planning items in a three-month period.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (February 2022) include: (1) distributed 1,060,000 contraceptives, accounting for 421,800 Couple Years Protection, preventing 87,990 pregnancies, 63,985 unintended births, 537 maternal deaths, and 9,047 unsafe abortions; (2) prevented 10,909 service delivery points from contraceptive stock-outs for three months, ensuring an uninterrupted supply of modern contraceptives over three or six months; and (3) trained 769 health workers (128 men and 641 women) to collectively improve product availability and identify and solve supply chain issues.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Making Motherhood Safe</title>
    <description>This project aims to mobilize a rapid response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from private sector health facilities in Dar es Salaam. The project is a public private partnership that increases coordination in providing health care services, procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) and training health care workers on COVID-19 preparedness. Dar es Salaam is at the epicenter of COVID-19 Tanzania. The pandemic has already overwhelmed public facilities, and the Government of Tanzania has requested support from the private sector in responding to the crisis. This effort is coordinated by an association of private sector health facilities (both for-profit and not-for-profit), which includes the Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT). CCBRT has on-site training facilities and expertise in providing training to nurses and doctors for 23 facilities where the majority of births take place in Dar es Salaam. This allows CCBRT to intervene to provide training and PPE, ensuring essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) care continues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

    <title>Nigeria Crisis – Emergency Assistance – International Rescue Committee 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 - Twelve years of conflict between Islamist insurgents and government forces in northeastern Nigeria have left the region facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, characterized by mass population displacement and severe human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. Destruction of infrastructure has left most of the population without access to safe water, sanitation or health care. Widespread food insecurity, worsened by the ongoing impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, has left the region on the brink of famine. Across the three conflict-affected states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, an estimated 8.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2022.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee is improving access to health care, including therapeutic treatment for acute malnutrition, safe water and sanitation, and protection services for up 56,869 conflict-affected internally displaced persons and host communities in Nigeria’s Borno state.  Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care services and training support for local health facilities; (2) identifying and treating acute malnutrition; (3) rehabilitating or establishing water points and sanitation facilities in targeted communities; and (4) providing gender-based violence services to at-risk women and children.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Internally Displaced People in Somalia - World Vision 2021-2022</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Despite progress towards sustainable political stability, the impact of more than three decades of insecurity, exacerbated by frequently recurring drought, increasing seasonal flooding, an ongoing historic infestation of desert locusts, and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, has left much of the population without access to basic services and ever more vulnerable to the next shock. Internal displacement remains at record levels, with an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) living in more than 2,400 sites across the country, and severe food insecurity is projected to increase in 2021, as a La Niña weather event is expected to bring renewed drought conditions early in the year. Altogether, an estimated 5.9 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, World Vision is improving access to healthcare, including treatment of acute malnutrition, safe water and sanitation, and protection services amongst crisis-affected IDPs and host communities in Somalia’s Bay region. Project activities include: (1) providing training and support for local health workers and facilities; (2) expanding water supply systems in IDP settlements; and, (3) working with local stakeholders to improve reporting and response mechanisms for sexual and gender-based violence and other protection concerns.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees in Ethiopia - Oxfam 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - Prior to the outbreak of conflict in the Tigray region in late 2020, Ethiopia was already facing ongoing acute humanitarian need, arising from sporadic but widespread intercommunal conflict, regional drought and flooding, swarms of desert locusts, the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of hosting nearly 800,000 refugees throughout the country. Together, these crises have led to widespread food insecurity, high levels of acute malnutrition, and significant population displacement. Although ongoing fighting and other access restrictions have hindered full needs assessments in Tigray, an estimated 29 million people in Ethiopia are likely to require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam is rehabilitating and upgrading critical water, sanitation, and hygiene systems and services for South Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopia’s Gambella region. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating existing water supply systems; (2) constructing latrines and waste disposal facilities; and b(3) conducting community campaigns promoting knowledge of sanitation and hygiene.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for Refugees in Uganda - CLWR 2021-2022</title>
    <description>February 2021 – Uganda currently hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, and the fourth largest in the world, more than 1.4 million people, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of these live in settlements in Uganda’s remote northern and western regions, relying on humanitarian assistance to meet their essential needs. Protection is a particular concern, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated inequities related to gender, age, and other factors already felt within the displaced population.  With GAC’s support, Canadian Lutheran World Relief (CLWR) is working to reduce vulnerability to and address the impacts of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and other protection risks facing women and girls and persons with special needs in South Sudanese refugee and local host communities in Uganda. Project activities include: (1) working with local stakeholders to improve reporting and response mechanisms for SGBV and other protection concerns; (2) providing shelter and household sanitation facilities for highly-vulnerable community members; and (3) providing case-management and other support for survivors of SGBV.</description>

    <title>Renforcement des services et des systèmes de réponse à la violence basée sur le genre à Cabo Delgado</title>
    <description>This project increases support for women and girls’ rights and protection from gender-based violence (GBV) in selected districts of Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique. It does this by strengthening the GBV response from multiple sectors and enhancing community systems that support women and girls’ rights,  including through preventing GBV and other harmful practices. Project activities include: (1) training and monitoring teams from multiple sectors (for example, healthcare workers and school gender focal points/contacts) at provincial and district levels on GBV case management; (2) supporting the Cabo Delgado GBV development partner coordination group in their humanitarian and development interventions; (3) creating safe spaces for women and girls that provide mentoring and life-skills lessons, vocational training and start-up kits for income generation in four target districts; and (4) supporting women’s associations and organizations of persons with disabilities to improve their GBV case management capacity. The project focuses on reaching vulnerable groups with GBV services and referrals. These vulnerable groups include women and girls and people living with disabilities and albinism.</description>

    <title>Responding to COVID-19 in Guatemala using Digital Health</title>
    <description>This project aims to decrease COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity in Guatemala, especially within Indigenous populations in the target regions of Alta Verapaz, El Quiche, Huehuetenango and Sololá. The project intends to strengthen the capacity of 3,500 health personnel to use digital systems to maintain quality and intercultural health services, particularly for women, girls and those experiencing marginalization or vulnerability. Project activities include: (1) providing equipment to deliver distance education programs to priority Ministry of Health training sites; (2) providing training to health personnel and authorities to deliver COVID-19 distance education training; (3) providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Health to develop standardization practices and resources for culturally-sensitive teleconsultation in response to COVID-19; and (4) providing training to health personnel to use a nationally integrated digital system to collect and monitor COVID-19 data.  This initiative expects to improve health services for 3.7 million people in Alta Verapaz, El Quiche, Huehuetenango and Sololá in Guatemala. This includes 3.1 million Indigenous people (1.6 million women and girls).</description>

    <title>Life-saving Public health and Vaccine Communication at scale in sub-Saharan</title>
    <description>This project supports ongoing efforts to counter COVID-19 misinformation, increase public vaccine confidence and support demand where vaccines are available. In 2020, Farm Radio International (FRI) implemented a short-term initiative  providing gender-responsive interactive programming as an extension of their current GAC-funded Scale Her Voice on Air project. This short-term project contributes to dispelling myths and misinformation about COVID-19 in ten countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Building on these results, the current project increases the previous initiative’s geographic activity scope while disseminating gender-responsive COVID-19 content resources in up to 37 sub-Saharan African countries.  Project activities include: (1) researching, developing and distributing 18-24 quality, gender-responsive Covid-19 content resources; (2) providing intensive, gender-responsive training and networking support; (3) linking broadcasters with national public health, livelihoods and gender experts; and (4) engaging in meaningful dialogue with communities, women, poor and vulnerable small-scale farmers in rural areas about their needs and opportunities concerning public health, gender equality and livelihood practices.  The project distributes resources to 1,080 radio partners in 37 countries and  expects to reach an estimated audience of 30 million, of whom 40% will be women. In addition, the project is offering training and networking services to 18 focus countries where FRI has operational partnerships and offices. These countries include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia.  Also, the project expects that these additional services will reach 17,500 listeners, of whom 30% will be women.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund – Tigray – OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>November 2020 - Conflict between the Federal Government of Ethiopia forces and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front in Ethiopia’s northernmost Tigray Regional State, has led to a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. Prior to the outbreak of conflict, more than 850,000 people in the region were already facing food insecurity, due to a severe desert locust infestation and the economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The ongoing conflict is causing significant new population displacement, increased food insecurity and health risks, and serious protection concerns, affecting an estimated additional 1.1 million people. Humanitarian access to those in need, in a shifting security environment, also remains a serious challenge.  With GAC’s support and through the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. This funding works to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations throughout the year, including the conflict in the Tigray region.  Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response, by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Support for Conflict-Affected Persons in Syria - 2020</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over nine years into the conflict, an estimated 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services to up to 184,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) providing safe water to crisis-affected communities; (2) rehabilitating community water networks; (3) improving sanitation facilities; and (4) distributing hygiene non-food item kits.</description>

    <title>Tanzania Demographic Health Survey</title>
    <description>This project supports the 2020-21 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey (TDHS), which includes the Malaria Indicator Survey and the Micronutrient Survey. The overall objective of the survey is to produce results in a timely manner and ensure that the data is disseminated widely so that it is useful to program managers and policy makers in government and non-governmental organizations. Project activities include: (1) supporting Tanzania’s own human resources to foster and reinforce Tanzania’s ownership of data collection, analysis, presentation and use; and (2) strengthening national capacities to use the survey data to identify and address demographic and health-related social needs, develop strategies for equitable growth and social poverty reduction, and link these strategies to national development plans. The survey is undertaken in a representative sample of women ages 15-49 years and children under five years from 16,354 households from all 31 regions in the country, as well as men aged 15-49 years in half of the households. The survey is designed to produce representative estimates of the main demographic and health indictors for the country as a whole as well as the following breakdowns: urban and rural at the country-wide level, Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian mainland, urban Zanzibar, rural Zanzibar, Zanzibar and nine geographical zones. This information is vital for effective planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation for health, nutrition and gender equality interventions, including those in maternal, newborn, adolescent and child health and sexual and reproductive health and rights.</description>

    <title>Prevention of the use of children in armed forces and armed groups in Jongeli</title>
    <description>This project aims to prevent boys and girls from being used by armed forces and armed groups in Akobo and Bor South counties and in the Pibor Administrative Area in South Sudan through community-led violence reduction and child recruitment prevention interventions. Project activities include: (1) facilitating inter-county peace and protection dialogue between the Dinka, Murle and Nuer communities within the geographic target areas by leveraging complementary and ongoing programming currently implemented by organization partners; (2) facilitating a joint analysis of conflict drivers and child recruitment pathways with targeted communities; (3) developing and implementing community-led actions to contribute towards violence reduction and the use of children in armed forces and/or armed groups within these communities; (4) offering opportunities to the families of children particularly vulnerable to develop safe livelihood options to counter the factors that lead children to engage with armed forces or armed groups; (5) preventing child recruitment and abduction, particularly  girls, through community engagement work that challenges inequality, combats sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and supports girls’ empowerment; and (6) supporting national-level advocacy work on this issue, alongside UNICEF and the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan.  This project helps by creating a space for intra-community dialogue that is driven by and supports, ongoing community and national-level advocacy to prevent the recruitment and use of children affected by armed forces and group. This project creates a protective environment that sustainably prioritizes children’s rights and prevents child recruitment. The project is delivered by the Danish Refugee Council as the consortium lead, along with War Child Holland and the Community Initiative for Development Organization, a national NGO.</description>

    <title>Sexual Reproductive Health and Gender-Based Violence response to COVID-19 – IRC – Yemen - 2021</title>
    <description>April 2021 – The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic defines global health crisis of modern times, with over 2,000,000 recorded deaths worldwide. In countries already experiencing humanitarian crises or with highly vulnerable populations, COVID-19 has placed even more pressure on essential services, infrastructure and systems. It has also resulted in adverse effects on women and girls’ provision and use of health and protection services.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provides protection and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) support to over 67,000 refugees and vulnerable people in Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing prompt and effective treatment to children for communicable and non-communicable diseases; (2) training and motivating health workers to provide curative consultations; (3) screening and treating children aged 0-59 months for malnutrition; (4) providing emergency obstetrics and neonatal care centres with medical equipment and personal protective equipment; (5) providing SRHR services and information to  women and girls, at community and facility levels; (6) providing clinical care for survivors of sexual assault, referrals for gender-based violence (GBV) case management and referrals for focused psychosocial support for survivors or those at risk of GBV; and (7) disseminating information through sessions on SRHR issues and the GBV response services available for targeted communities.</description>

    <title>Nagorno-Karabakh &amp; Ethiopia - Emergency Assistance to Affected People - ICRC 2020</title>
    <description>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect the lives and dignity of people affected by conflict and other situations of violence. The ICRC provides assistance and prevents further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s humanitarian operations in Nagorno-Karabakh, on both sides of the line of contact, and the Tigray region of Ethiopia aim to provide protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise to strengthen their capacity in areas such as promoting international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and delivering relief in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees.</description>

    <title>Emergency Support to UNICEF – Haiti – 2022</title>
    <description>November 2022 – On October 2, after more than three years without cases, Haiti reported cholera cases in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince. Since then, the disease has spread considerably to other regions of the country. As of November 14, according to the Pan American Health Organization, there have been more than 7,500 suspected cholera cases. Furthermore, this cholera resurgence is happening in a complex operational context, with rampant insecurity, access constraints, and insufficient infrastructures to meet humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the United Nations Children’s Fund provides additional water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) support to crisis-affected people in Haiti. Project activities include: (1) deploying WASH mobile teams to highly affected areas; (2) conducting awareness raising or hygiene promotion activities; (3) distributing medical and water, hygiene and sanitation kits; and (4) distributing supplies to improve access to safe drinking water.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Border Security and Strategic Trade Through Resolution 1540</title>
    <description>This project aims to assist up to 15 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to better meet their UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540 obligations through the development of legal and regulatory frameworks on border security and strategic trade controls for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials and equipment. Project activities include: (1) developing control list frameworks and omnibus strategic trade legislation to criminalize the proliferation of CBRN materials; (2) developing UNSCR 1540 national action plans and border security management strategies; and (3) delivering commodity identification training and strategic trade control enforcement programming in beneficiary states.</description>

    <title>Syria and Iraq Crises - Supporting the Safety of Humanitarian Workers</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The ongoing crises in Syria and Iraq continues to drive protracted displacement and humanitarian needs across the region. Over 10 years into the Syrian conflict, an estimated 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria, and 4.1 million persons in Iraq. In both countries, these needs have been met with large-scale humanitarian responses implemented by hundreds of implementing organizations working in high-risk environments. These humanitarian responses in Syria have also been marred by countless attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel.  With GAC’s support, this project works to support humanitarian organizations in fulfilling their mandates safely by providing timely information and assistance in mitigating risk. Project activities include: (1) providing daily reporting including incident reports, analytical reports and thematic reports; (2) facilitating coordination meetings on access, safety and security amongst humanitarian organizations; (3) providing expert advice on risk mitigation at all stages of clients’  program cycle; and (4) provision of capacity building and crisis response to humanitarian organizations, including reviews of partner security plans and policies, free training courses in security management and conflict analysis.</description>

    <title>Health and protection services for vulnerable people - Multi-Country - 2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 - More than 7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in the region, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict.  With GAC’s support, this project is helping to improve access to life-saving protection and health services to vulnerable people in Colombia and Venezuela. The project will provide gender-responsive protection and health services, including SRH, through the deployment of mobile teams. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care services, including SRH, through the deployment mobile health teams;( 2) providing comprehensive protection services, including GBV case management, psychosocial and legal support; and (3) raising awareness on GBV and SRH and protection and health services available.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies – World Health Organization 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts. The WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial, acute response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  With GAC’S support, the CFE helps WHO react early to prevent escalation of health emergencies. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; and (4) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Health Services in Venezuela</title>
    <description>March 2022 – The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens, and heavily impacting the ability of people to meet basic needs. Over 5.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  With GAC's support, this project will help address the essential health needs of up to 25,000 crisis-affected people within Venezuela, particularly those currently in transit along migratory routes. Project activities include: (1) providing quality primary health care for migrant populations within Venezuela; (2) sensitizing communities on the availability of health services and health centers along migratory routes; and (3) providing mental health and psychosocial support services in supported health centers and mobile clinics.</description>

    <title>Coronavirus - Emergency Response - PAHO 2020</title>
    <description>In late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported by health authorities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 30, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and on 11 March 2020, a pandemic. The PAHO and its partners are working with national governments in the Americas and global experts to identify populations most at risk, the transmission of the disease, and the most effective ways to detect, interrupt, and contain human to human transmission.  With GAC’s support, PAHO is helping vulnerable countries control and respond to COVID-19 cases in the Americas. Project activities include: (1) supporting national authorities in reorganizing their health services to limit human-human transmission within health facilities; (2) ensuring availability of laboratory supplies, reagents and tests; and (3) providing technical expertise to Member States.</description>

    <title>Enhancing the capabilities of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 in the Black Sea region</title>
    <description>This project contributes to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 capabilities in the Black Sea and Caucasus regions under the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World Customs Organization Container Control Program to reduce vulnerabilities of countries in these regions to transnational threats from non-state actors proliferating chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and dual-use materials. Project activities include: (1) developing and delivering a technical needs assessment in Armenia and Azerbaijan; (2) delivering strategic trade control training, cargo risk profiling, selection and inspection training to customs and law enforcement officers in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine; and (3) training for inter-agency personnel on strategic trade and export control “best practices”.</description>

    <title>Ebola Emergency support – World Food Programme – 2019</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations. With the support of GAC and other donors, WFP is providing emergency food assistance to more than 90 million people facing famine, malnutrition and severe food insecurity.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) providing supplementary feeding for children under five years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women; (3) supporting emergency school feeding programs; (4) giving vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) providing food for work.</description>

    <title>Coronavirus - Emergency Response - World Health Organization 2020</title>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts. In early 2020, the WHO and Chinese authorities identified a new coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in the People’s Republic of China. The WHO and its partners are working with Chinese authorities and global experts to identify populations most at risk, the transmission of the disease, and the most effective ways to detect, interrupt, and contain human to human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak in the China, a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”, indicating that the outbreak requires a more robust coordinated international response. The WHO released its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (February to April 2020) outlining its strategy to scale-up the response in order to stop further spread of the disease.  With GAC’s support, WHO’s emergency operations work to help and control the spread of the coronavirus and support the international response to the outbreak. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; and (4) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - Pan American Health Organization 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens and heavily impacting people’s ability to meet basic needs. Over 4.8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  With GAC’s support, the Pan American Health Organization is helping provide life-saving assistance to vulnerable populations affected by the Venezuela crisis. Project activities include: (1) providing basic health services, including vaccination, prenatal and postnatal care to vulnerable and at-risk people; (2) distributing essential medications and medical supplies to health facilities; and (3) providing nutritional support to vulnerable and at-risk people.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) strengthened international capacity to prevent, detect and respond to North Korean efforts to evade UN Security Council Resolution sanctions, including through illicit shipping, financial networks and cyber-crime; and (2) strengthened capacity of women experts to actively engage in nuclear security and non-proliferation policy discussions and development.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2022): (1) deployed 12 subject matter experts at five international events, conferences, and workshops and at two webinars to speak to 893 compliance officers about open-source resources available to professionals on North Korean sanctions evasion; (2) hosted three regional, remote workshops for shipping registry officials on the obligation of ship registries to ensure compliance with relevant international sanctions regimes and common sanctions evasion tactics deployed by North Korea. The workshops collectively trained 43 registry officials and yielded a guidance handbook in both Spanish and English; (3) conducted five cybercrime webinars, one side-event, and one workshop for a total of 2,917 frontline operational and compliance officials from around the world; (4) delivered three virtual training engagements for Central Bank financial regulators and supervisors on counter-proliferation finance and cybersecurity designed. This is to curb North Korea’s ability to generate revenue for the WMD and missile programs; (5) delivered two engagements with interagency government stakeholders responsible for regulating trade, maintaining national security, and overseeing financial transactions in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago; (6) delivered a two-day remote capacity-building workshop on the implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea with compliance professionals in Latin America and a follow-on remote webinar; and (7) engaged ten grantees from Argentina, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Turkey, and Ukraine to develop their subject matter knowledge and working skills, implement individual grant projects at their home institutions, and attend a capstone two-day workshop in Vienna, Austria.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - UNFPA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on March 25th, 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. The GHRP’s three strategic priorities include: (1) containing the spread of the pandemic; (2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and (3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is contributing to meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable women and girls, and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. Project activities include: (1) ensuring the continuity of national and local health system capacity to provide access to integrated quality sexual and reproductive health; (2) mitigating the impact on supply chain and logistics management for sexual and reproductive health supplies, ensuring continuity of supplies and care for life-saving sexual and reproductive health services; (3) providing and protecting health workers by ensuring that basic personal protection equipment is available; and (4) providing risk communication and community engagement for primary prevention and stigma reduction on COVID-19.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Venezuela Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>November 2020 - The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens, and heavily impacting people’s ability to meet basic needs. Nearly 5.5 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighboring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  This project represents Canada’s funding to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), for the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund (VHF). The VHF aims to provide timely allocations to national and international non-governmental organizations, as well as United Nations agencies, to address some of the most critical humanitarian needs in Venezuela. Project activities include: (1) addressing acute unmet emergency needs; (2) filling the highest priority gaps in protracted crises situations; (3) preventing a worsening of the situation and increased vulnerability; and (4) responding to new emergencies or sudden-onset disasters.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Emergency Response - Pan American Health Organization 2021</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens and heavily impacting people’s ability to meet basic needs. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health as well as water and sanitation services, and support to address food insecurity. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is helping provide life-saving assistance to vulnerable populations affected by the Venezuela crisis. As the specialized health agency for the Americas and the Regional Office of the World Health Organization, PAHO is also leading and coordinating, international efforts to fight the spread of COVID-19 in the region.  With GAC’s support, the PAHO works to provide essential support to at-risk populations in the region. Project activities include: (1) providing basic health services, including vaccination, prenatal and postnatal care to vulnerable and at-risk people; (2) distributing essential medications and medical supplies to health facilities; and (3) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Emergency Medical Response to Sexual and Reproductive Health in Columbia- Profamilia 2021-2023</title>
    <description>March 2021 - More than 5.4 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many now live in Colombia; however, others remain in transit to countries like Peru or Ecuador. In Colombia, the refugee and migrant crisis continues to drive significant humanitarian needs, as the country remains afflicted by violence and insecurity in some regions. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants have also been impacted significantly by the pandemic.  With GAC’s support, the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Profamilia work to improve access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and respond to sexual and gender-based violence in communities affected by the refugee and migrant crisis. Project activities include: (1) using Mobile Brigades to deliver comprehensive SRH services; (2) providing dignity kits to migrants with an emphasis on women and girls; and (3) delivering messages on gender-based violence and availability of support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Haiti Earthquake Matching Fund - Humanitarian Coalition 2021</title>
    <description>August 2021 – On Saturday, August 14, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake occurred 13 kilometres southeast of Petit-Trou-de-Nippes in Haiti. The earthquake caused severe damage to infrastructure, affecting approximately 800,000 people living along the coast of Haiti’s southern peninsula, particularly in the departments of Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud. Haiti’s Prime Minister declared a state of emergency in the country and the Government of Haiti requested international assistance.  An effective and timely humanitarian assistance response is essential to address the immediate life-saving needs of disaster-affected people. In order to respond to this crisis, Global Affairs Canada launched the Haiti Earthquake Matching Fund in partnership with the Humanitarian Coalition and its members. Through this mechanism, the Government of Canada is matching the eligible donations made to the Humanitarian Coalition and its members, up to $2 million.  The funds are used by Humanitarian Coalition members to deliver life-saving assistance to those most in need. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health, psychosocial support and protection services to affected communities.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - Development and Peace 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, close to 1 million Rohingya refugees live in 33 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar and almost 20,000 have been relocated to the island of Bhasan Char. Refugees continue to face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are highly reliant on international assistance to meet basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Development and Peace and its local partner, Caritas Bangladesh, provide safe shelters and secure settlements to Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, using a community-based approach. Project activities include: (1) providing training on shelter construction, maintenance and upgrade to refugee households; (2) distributing construction materials and providing technical assistance; (3) facilitating community groups to develop site improvement action plans; and (4) undertaking site improvement works.</description>

    <title>Bangladesh - Humanitarian Response to the Rohingya Crisis - International Rescue Committee 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – Following the outbreak of violence in Northern Rakhine State in August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh over a period of several months. Currently, close to 1 million Rohingya refugees live in 33 highly congested settlements in Cox’s Bazar and almost 20,000 have been relocated to the island of Bhasan Char. Refugees continue to face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are highly reliant on international assistance to meet basic needs.  With GAC’s support, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and their local partner, Young Power in Social Action, are helping improve the health and safety of Rohingya refugees by providing integrated gender-based violence prevention and response services. Project activities include: (1) operating integrated women’s centres and providing survivor-centred sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management services and sexual and reproductive health support for women, girls and other marginalized community members; (2) training service providers in comprehensive SGBV, psychosocial support and case management processes; and (3) conducting outreach and awareness-raising sessions in the broader refugee community.</description>

    <title>Multisector reponse to the migrant crisis in Colombia -  Development and Peace 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 - More than 5.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in Colombia, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants, have also been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  With support from GAC, Development and Peace is helping to improve the ability of migrants and refugees to meet their basic needs. The project promotes access to safe and appropriate housing, as well as improved knowledge of the process of regularizing migratory status and preventing risks associated with migration in the departments of Narino, Norte de Santander and Valle del Cauca in Colombia. Project activities include: (1) providing unconditional multi-purpose cash transfers to vulnerable Venezuelan migrants to cover their basic needs; (2) providing free accommodation services that are safe and appropriate for vulnerable Venezuelan migrants; and (3) providing psychological and legal counselling to vulnerable Venezuelan migrants.</description>

    <title>Venezuela Crisis - Improving Access to Health Services</title>
    <description>March 2022 – The crisis in Venezuela has resulted in severe food and fuel shortages, record hyperinflation and the collapse of the health system, putting both food and medicine out of reach for many citizens, and heavily impacting the ability of people to meet basic needs. Over 5.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighboring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Venezuela, vulnerable and crisis-affected populations are in need of critical assistance, including basic health assistance, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene.  With GAC's support, this project helps address the essential health needs of up to 55,000 vulnerable people affected by the crisis, specifically from communities that are difficult to access due to violence or their remote location. Project activities include: (1) providing quality primary health care for migrant populations and (2) providing mental health and psychosocial support services available in supported health centers and mobile clinics, including gender-based violence services.</description>

The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, power and water infrastructure damage, and people’s displacement, mainly towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that more than 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance, with more than 500,000 people fleeing to neighbouring countries and more than 100,000 people internally displaced.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross Society (CRCS) dispatches emergency relief supplies to support the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in meeting the emergency shelter and water, sanitation and hygiene needs of people impacted by the crisis in Ukraine and surrounding countries.</description>

    <title>Sri Lanka – Humanitarian Crisis – UNICEF 2022</title>
    <description>June 2022 – Since March 2020, Sri Lanka has been facing a growing economic and financial crisis. This crisis intensified throughout 2021, leading to a shortage of essential food and non-food items, significant increases in commodity prices and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. The key humanitarian impacts include the loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, lack of drinking water, power cuts and shortages of life-saving medicines, among other issues. The United Nations estimates that 5.7 million people across 25 districts of Sri Lanka require humanitarian assistance as a result of this multi-dimensional crisis.  With GAC’s support, UNICEF works to meet the immediate nutrition and health needs of the most vulnerable populations in Sri Lanka and to help prevent and treat malnutrition through the continuation and scale-up of critical nutrition-specific programs. Project activities include: (1) treating children with malnutrition, and providing access to micronutrients; and (2) providing essential medicines, supplies and devices.</description>

    <title>Sri Lanka Crisis – Emergency Response - WFP 2022</title>
    <description>November 2022 – Since March 2020, Sri Lanka has been facing a growing economic and financial crisis. This crisis intensified throughout the past year, leading to a shortage of essential food and non-food items, significant increases in commodity prices and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. The key humanitarian impacts include the loss of livelihoods, rising food insecurity, lack of drinking water, power cuts and shortages of life-saving medicines, among other issues. The United Nations estimates that 7 million people across all 25 districts of Sri Lanka require humanitarian assistance as a result of this multi-dimensional crisis.  With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP) is working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by the humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) delivering non-perishable nutritious foods to people in need; (2) providing emergency cash-for-work assistance in semi-urban and rural areas; (3) making multi-purpose cash transfers to cover immediate food needs and support livelihoods; and (4) facilitating transport and emergency logistics response equipment.</description>

    <title>Improving Access to Health Services in Colombia - Doctors of the World 2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 - More than 7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015. Many of them reside in Colombia, but others are in transit in Colombia to countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The refugee and migrant crisis continues to create significant humanitarian needs in Colombia, while also exacerbating the effects of long-standing violence and armed conflict. Populations with acute humanitarian needs, including refugees and migrants, have also been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  With support from GAC, Doctors of the World is helping to improve the health status of crisis-affected people, particularly women and adolescent girls, in Valle del Cauca, Nariño, and the Ipiales – Cali – Pereira migration route. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, SRH services, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to vulnerable refugee and migrant populations as well as host communities; and (2) providing training to improve quality of the above mentioned services to crisis-affected populations.</description>

    <title>Support to the Contingency Fund for Emergencies – World Health Organization - 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 – The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks and conflicts. The WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) is a replenishable fund established to provide the resources necessary to rapidly scale up WHO’s initial acute response to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences. The Fund is designed to fill critical funding gaps from the beginning of an emergency until the organization can access additional sources of funds.  With GAC’s support, the CFE helps the WHO react early to prevent escalation of health emergencies. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; and (4) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Afghanistan Crisis  - Emergency Response - UNHCR 2022</title>
    <description>December 2021 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs have worsened, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2022, an estimated 24 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally displaced persons. With the support of GAC and other donors, the project aims to provide assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in Afghanistan. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihood support; (4) providing protection (including against sexual and gender-based violence and including child protection), working to register asylum seekers and refugees, and helping to issue identity documents; and (5) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for persons of concern.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for the project include: (1) improved delivery of essential health services to mothers, pregnant women, newborns and children under five; and (2) Increased collection, dissemination, and use of community-level maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition health data  The expected outcomes for the project’s COVID-19 response include: (1) increased capacity of Ministry of Health to incorporate COVID-19 data into decision-making processes using the real-time community digital health surveillance system; (2) leverage the project’s IT infrastructure for distance training of health personnel to reduce risk of COVID-19 spread; (3) reinforce the communication system in project regions and promote the dissemination of essential prevention information to the population; and (4) access to essential Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers, minimizing risk of infection for this group of workers.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project by the Tula Foundation through the support of the Government of Canada (December 2021) include:  (1) contributed to the reduction of maternal mortality rate by an average of 23% in Alta Verapaz, El Quiché, Huehuetenango and Sololá; (2) reduced the number of deaths of children under the age of five by an average of 71% in target regions; (3) 29,637 health personnel and community health workers (16,989 women and 12,648 men, including 19,621 Indigenous persons) completed distance education programs to address maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition; (4) provided training for 4,981 community health workers and health personnel participants (2,775 women and 2,206 men) in Alta Verapaz, El Quiché, Huehuetenango, and Sololá and smartphone equipment to enhance their capacity to use a community eHealth system to improve the delivery of maternal, newborn and child health, nutrition health and COVID-19 services. This resulted in the registration of more than 1.8M calls for clinical support such as transport, follow-up, consultation and coordination; (5) contributed to an increased collection, dissemination and use of community-level maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition health data. Since the beginning of the project; (6) 7,694 health officials, health personnel and community health workers (4,301 women and 3,393 men) accessed community health information for decision-making support via the community eHealth system; and (7) coordinated with the Ministry of Health in 2020 to update the eHealth system to allow users to register COVID-19 cases for monitoring, follow-up and resources planning. This improved the time required to access information. The average transfer time between collection and accessibility of health data by the community eHealth system records at approximately 21 minutes; significantly better than the project target of 24 hours.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Water, Hygiene and Sanitation, and Shelter Assistance in Ecuador - CARE 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 - Over 3.3 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, many of whom are currently residing in neighbouring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Ecuador is both a transit and destination country for refugees and migrants from Venezuela, with an estimated 500,000 people in need of assistance. Many are in need of basic health assistance, food and nutrition assistance, protection services, shelter, and water and sanitation.  With GAC’s support, CARE is helping address the basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter and protection needs of up to 11,000 crisis-affected people in Tulcan, Ibarra, Quito and Huaquillas in Ecuador. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating up to two temporary shelters; (2) establishing temporary safe spaces for women and girls; (3) providing multipurpose cash transfers to up to 5,000 households and people in transit; and (4) distributing hygiene kits to up to 3,500 people and 1,200 households (with children up to three years old).</description>

    <title>Burkina Faso Emergency support- World Food Programme -2019</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) supplementary feeding for children under five years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women; (3) emergency school feeding programs; (4) vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) food for work. With the support of GAC and other donors, WFP is providing emergency food assistance to more than 90 million people facing famine, malnutrition and severe food insecurity.</description>

    <title>Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Ongoing drought and population displacement caused by intercommunal conflict since late 2017 have left at least 8.4 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including emergency food rations, treatment for acute malnutrition and other healthcare services, and safe water and sanitation services. Additionally, some 700,000 refugees, from South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, and Sudan, are now living within Ethiopia’s borders and remain reliant on international assistance to meet their basic needs .  With GAC’s support and through the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations throughout the year. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Cameroon - Emergency Assistance in the North-West and South West Regions – Plan Canada 2020</title>
    <description>February 2020 - Conflict and instability has left Cameroon facing three distinct humanitarian situations: (i) internally displaced persons (IDPs) and Nigerian refugees residing in the conflict-affected Lake Chad basin; (ii) Central African refugees fleeing insecurity in Central African Republic (CAR); and (iii) conflict between Anglophone separatists and the Cameroonian government. With little prospect for the resolution of any of these situations, at least 4.4 million people in Cameroon are expected to require humanitarian assistance to meet their basic survival and protection needs in 2020.  With GAC's support, Plan International Canada is addressing the urgent protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs of over 21,000 internally displaced people and other conflict-affected people in the North West and South West regions. Project activities include: (1) establishing community-based safe spaces and structures; (2) delivering comprehensive case management support services to vulnerable children, including child survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; (3) providing cash/voucher assistance to crisis-affected adolescents, youth and vulnerable households; (4) constructing gender-responsive community-latrines including handwashing stations in communities hosting IDPs; and (5) conducting hygiene promotion and sanitation awareness sessions for children, adolescents, households comprising IDPs, and host community members.</description>

    <title>Central African Republic - Emergency Health Care - Doctors Without Borders Canada 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - After a brief period of calm in 2016, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) started to deteriorate in 2017. This has continued through late 2019, where a resurgence of direct confrontations between armed actors was observed. This, combined with continued insecurity, led to suspensions of movements of humanitarian actors, impacting the humanitarian response. CAR is one of the most dangerous contexts in the world for humanitarian workers. The crisis in CAR is a protection crisis, with violence against civilians, particularly women and girls, and sexual and gender-based violence cases commonplace. Approximately 35% of the population is food insecure and only 50% of the population has access to clean water. Regular violence across the country that is controlled by armed groups continues to exacerbate displacement; currently, over one quarter of the country's population is displaced, either internally (600,100) or as refugees in neighbouring countries (592,000).  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders Canada is providing emergency health services for up to 593,000 conflict-affected people in Ouham and Ouham-Pende prefectures in the Central African Republic. Project activities include: (1) providing primary health care, including 381,000 outpatient consultations and treating 300,000 people for malaria; (2) providing sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including 1,000 postnatal consultations and 3,400 assisted deliveries; and (3) providing secondary healthcare services, including 23,400 inpatient admissions and 9,800 pediatric admissions.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - Action Against Hunger 2020-2021</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and 2020 expects additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDPs) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands Congolese refugees.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 68,337 conflict-affected people in the Mweso Health Zone in the DRC. This project focuses on improving water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing access to basic health and sexual and reproductive health and rights services to conflict-affected people.  Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating 65 water points; (2) constructing 500 latrines; (3) providing training to up to 18,870 people in acute and several malnutrition prevention; and (4) providing training to up to 50 community health workers.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudanese Refugees and Host Communities in Ethiopia - 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – Ongoing drought and population displacement caused by intercommunal conflict since late 2017 have left at least 8.4 million Ethiopians in need of humanitarian assistance, including emergency food rations, treatment for acute malnutrition and other healthcare services, and safe water and sanitation services. Additionally, some 700,000 refugees, from South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, and Sudan, are now living within Ethiopia’s borders and remain reliant on international assistance to meet their basic needs.  With GAC’s support, Concern is providing treatment to address acute malnutrition for 20,000 South Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopia’s Gambella region. Project activities include therapeutic and preventative interventions to lower the rates of moderate and severe acute malnutrition.</description>

    <title>Nigeria – Response to Humanitarian Crisis – ALIMA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - A decade of conflict between government forces and Islamist insurgents in northeastern Nigeria has given rise to one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world, characterized by mass displacement and grave human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. In 2020, assessments indicate that 7.7 million people are expected to require humanitarian assistance, including emergency food rations, treatment for life-threatening severe acute malnutrition and other healthcare services, and protection for vulnerable women and girls at grave risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, ALIMA is providing access to life-saving emergency healthcare services to 75,500 conflict-affected people in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include providing support to the Monguno General Hospital as well as local health centres in five displacement camps and two host communities in Nigeria’s Borno State.</description>

    <title>Response to Nigeria Crisis - Save the Children Canada 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - A decade of conflict between government forces and Islamist insurgents in northeastern Nigeria has given rise to one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world, characterized by mass displacement and grave human rights abuses, including abductions, killings, and sexual violence. In 2020, assessments indicate that 7.7 million people are expected to require humanitarian assistance, including emergency food rations, treatment for life-threatening severe acute malnutrition and other healthcare services, and protection for vulnerable women and girls at grave risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children Canada is providing nutrition and protection assistance to an estimated 152,000 conflict-affected people in Nigeria’s Borno state. Project activities include: (1) providing technical and materiel support to local health facilities to improve delivery of nutrition treatment services; (2) providing cash or other inputs to vulnerable households to combat malnutrition; and (3) implementing activities to strengthen referral and response systems for sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>DRC - Emergency Assistance - Save the Children 2020-2021</title>
    <description>February 2020 - The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by inter-ethnic conflict and widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence. In 2020, 15.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, a 22% increase from 2019, and 2020 expects additional population movement, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods, and food security. Currently, the DRC is home to the second largest food crisis, with almost 16 million people severely food insecure. In addition, it is home to the largest internally-displaced persons (IDPs) population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people. These needs are exacerbated by the ongoing Ebola outbreak, increased violence, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands Congolese refugees.  With GAC’s support, Save the Children is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 141,055 conflict-affected people in the Djugu and Irumu territory of DRC. This project focuses on preventing and treating malnutrition, and providing protection services to at-risk children.  Project activities include: (1) providing treatment to children under the age of five who are suffering from severe, acute malnutrition and diseases that exacerbate malnutrition; (2) providing case management, response services and referrals to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, unaccompanied and separated children, children associated with armed groups, and other at-risk girls and boys; and (3) providing training to community health workers in sexual and gender based violence response services.</description>

    <title>Uganda - Humanitarian Assistance for Refugees and Host Communities - CARE 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, and the third largest in the world, close to 1.4 million people, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. March 2020 - Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, and the third largest in the world, close to 1.4 million people, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the refugees are women and children, who are almost wholly reliant on international assistance to meet their basic needs. Although gaps exist across all sectors of the humanitarian response, protection is particularly critical to address needs arising from sexual and gender-based violence experienced while fleeing conflict, and often continuing in the refugee settlements.  With GAC’s support, CARE is providing access to critical healthcare and protection services to an estimated 25,000 South Sudanese and Congolese refugees living in Uganda’s Arua district. Project activities include: (1) increasing sexual and reproductive health services through support to existing health systems; and (2) strengthening local mechanisms to respond to and prevent sexual and gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) - FAO 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on March 25th, 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. The GHRP’s three strategic priorities: (1) containing the spread of the pandemic; (2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and (3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  Project activities include: (1) working with governments to scale-up social protection systems, direct cash injections where feasible, and cash+ schemes; (2) providing time-critical inputs, technical advice, support to livelihood diversification and home production, support to production, transformation, marketing and exchange of food products for internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees, support food production in camps, and scale-up cash-based programming; (3) incentivizing continued production, and strengthening agricultural cooperatives to maintain negotiation power for farmers; (4) working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to share messages and raise awareness of COVID-19 among food chain actors; and (5) improved understanding of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on food security and the food supply chains, at country and global level.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) continues to play a critical coordination role through co-leadership of the global and national Food Security Cluster, and providing technical support for food security information and analyses, needs and impact assessments, early warning and monitoring systems, data collection and surveys, etc.</description>

    <title>Moldova and Romania - Emergency Response - Relief Supplies - CRCS - 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – On February 23, 2022, Russia initiated an invasion of Ukraine. The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, power and water infrastructure damage, and people’s displacement, mainly towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that 12 million people require humanitarian assistance, with more than 3.8 million people fleeing to neighbouring countries and over 6.5 million people internally displaced.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross Society (CRCS) is helping with logistical support to help dispatch solicited emergency relief supplies to support humanitarian partners to meet the emergency shelter needs of people impacted by the crisis in Ukraine and the region.</description>

    <title>All Mothers and Children Count - COVID-19 Response</title>
    <description>This initiative aims to reduce illness and death among women of reproductive age, newborns and children under five by working with local health authorities. Project activities include: (1) training women and men health workers and traditional birth attendants to dispense accurate advice on ante and post-natal care, promote healthy habits, provide basic health care, identify high risk pregnancies and make referrals to government-run medical facilities; (2) equipping a select number of health centers with essential equipment to reduce infection, monitor vital signs of fetuses and facilitate night time deliveries; (3) constructing dispensaries, nurses' houses and expectant mothers' houses to encourage facility based delivery; (4) providing rapid and affordable transport to medical facilities; (5) improving access to clean water and nutritious food; and (6) mobilizing and equipping communities and village leaders for sustainability of MNCH and gender results.  The program will respond to COVID-19  while ensuring that women and girls continue to have access to SRH services, safe deliveries, pre and post-natal care, and contraceptive access. COVID-19 response activities include: (1) scaling up water, sanitation and hygiene interventions, including the distribution of soap and hand sanitizer; (2) distributing hygiene and safety kits to health workers and community leaders; (3) procuring personal protective equipment for clinical staff and setting up temporary tents to allow for covered physical distancing at clinics; (4) tele-coaching/tele-monitoring community health workers to deliver information and educate the community in a safe, distanced manner; and (5) educating communities on personal protective measures, physical distancing and home isolation via megaphone, radio and distanced community health worker interventions.  This initiative is expected to contribute directly to the improved health and nutrition of approximately 2.5 million women, men and children and in addition, around 1 million individuals. The project is implemented with local partners in each country: VHW in Burundi, EHALE in Mozambique, Inshuti Mu Buzima (Partners in Health) in Rwanda, and the Anglican Diocese of Masasi in Tanzania.</description>

    <title>Standing Together for Nutrition – Micronutrient Forum</title>
    <description>The project responds to the urgent need for improved, geospatially indicative and timely data to better understand who is suffering from increased hunger and malnutrition due to COVID-19. Standing Together for Nutrition (STfN) is hosted by the Micronutrient Forum and co-chaired by the Micronutrient Forum and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. It includes partners such as John Hopkins University, the International Food Policy Research Institute, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, UNICEF, and Results for Development.  Standing Together for Nutrition is a unique consortium of food security, nutrition, health and economic experts from global, regional and local institutes in low- and middle- income countries. STfN aims to quantify the scale of problems related to food security and nutrition due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This project supports STfN with a budget of $1.09 million over 18-months.  Project activities include: (1) promoting the collection and dissemination of data and modelling COVID-19’s impact on nutrition with a focus on how gender and other inequalities can be addressed; (2) increasing the effectiveness of COVID-19 response programming for nutrition by generating and disseminating nutrition data on women, children and vulnerable populations to inform decision-making; and (3) synthesizing and harmonizing data to inform national and global nutrition policies and program priorities.</description>

    <title>UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women and Girls - 02</title>
    <description>This project represents emergency support of $2 million to the United Nations Women's Trust Fund on Violence Against Women (UNTF). Canada's emergency funding is allocated to the UNTF's COVID-19 Special Funding Window. Project activities include: (1) supporting the core capacity of UNTF's existing grantees (which are primarily women’s rights organizations) to ensure the stability of gender-based violence projects and the long term sustainability of the organizations; and (2) supporting the COVID-19 Response Special Funding Window for a targeted call for proposals to fund projects designed to support women and girls survivors of the gender-based violence related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating gender-based violence, especially against women and girls. Multiple forms of violence are occurring during the pandemic and the most commonly reported is intimate partner violence. This violence is fueled by  financial insecurity within households related to quarantine measures. In many cities and communities around the world, emergency services and institutional responses are overwhelmed by the COVID-19 health crisis.  These and other service providers have rapidly lost the capacity to respond to the needs of women and girl survivors of violence. Civil society and women's organizations are playing a critical role at the community level and their sustained operations are vital to a comprehensive and successful pandemic response.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal – UNICEF</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the well-being of children in eight regions of Senegal (Matam, Sédhiou, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Kolda, Kédougou, Tambacounda and Ziguinchor) and to offer them adequate protection during their schooling so that they can live and study within structures that ensure their safety and give them every opportunity possible to be successful. The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students’ and communities’ awareness of children’s rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.  Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection; (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders’ awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever); (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices; and (4) raising economic operators’ awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.  The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.  This project is one of the three components of the “Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal” project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education). It is part of Senegal’s National Child Protection Strategy (SNPE - 2013–2018) and the Program for Improvements to Quality, Equity and Transparency in Education (PAQUET – 2013–2025).</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased involvement of government and local institutions in prevention and child protection, considering international standards and gender-specific differences; (2) improved access by boys and girls in deprived areas to a safe, equitable and violence-free school environment, which helps to protect them and promotes their effective participation in school; and (3) increased protection provided by local actors in formal and informal protection systems against, and prevention of, labour-based abuse and exploitation for boys and girls in the targeted areas.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2021) include: (1) provided 4,297 schools with sanitary and hygiene products (hydroalcoholic gel, soap, bleach, sanitary towels), protective equipment (recyclable and surgical masks, latex gloves, thermo-flash) and hand-washing devices. This made it possible to properly ensure the resumption of teaching and learning for the reopening of classes in November 2020, in compliance with health and teaching protocols; (2) reached 1,176,685 people through radio shorts on managing Covid-19-related stress, preventing and detecting child abuse and neglect; (3) a digital awareness campaign on barrier gestures, stress management and the prevention of child abuse in times of health crisis, via Facebook and Instagram, reached 1,732,622 people, including 427,298 who liked, shared or commented on the publications; and (4) 50,000 school-age children and young people from impoverished families, 55% of them girls, benefited from school supplies. This is a major contribution to enabling these children to return to school once classes have reopened.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria and Iraq Crises - Supporting the Safety of Humanitarian Workers</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crises in Syria and Iraq continues to drive protracted displacement and humanitarian needs across the region. Over 9 years into the Syrian conflict, an estimated 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria, and 4.1 million persons in Iraq. In both countries, these needs have been met with large-scale humanitarian responses implemented by hundreds of implementing organizations working in high-risk environments. These humanitarian responses in Syria have also been marred by countless attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel.  With GAC’s support, this project works to support humanitarian organizations in fulfilling their mandates safely by providing timely information and assistance in mitigating risk. Project activities include: (1) providing daily reporting including incident reports, analytical reports and thematic reports; (2) facilitating coordination meetings on access, safety and security amongst humanitarian organizations; (3) providing expert advice on risk mitigation at all stages of clients’  program cycle; and (4) provision of capacity building and crisis response to humanitarian organizations, including reviews of partner security plans and policies, free training courses in security management and conflict analysis.</description>

    <title>Support to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund - OCHA 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 - The impact of three decades of conflict and insecurity, exacerbated by chronic drought and other natural disasters, has left Somalia facing widespread food insecurity, acute malnutrition, and population displacement. In 2020, 5.3 million people in Somalia (an estimated 42% of the population) are expected to require humanitarian assistance. At least 1.4 million Somalis, primarily women and children, are facing acute malnutrition and 2.6 million are now internally displaced. While the political situation in Somalia has been gradually improving, households continue to face deeply entrenched needs and remain vulnerable to sudden shocks.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities, such as shelter, healthcare and protection, by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Syria – Health – 5 – 2021-2022</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over ten years into the conflict, an estimate 13 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance. This includes more than 2.7 Internally displaced people, many of whom live in informal and overcrowded settlements, where access to essential needs and services is inadequate. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions, and humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide multisector, lifesaving and gender sensitive response to up to 154,710 beneficiaries. Project activities include: (1) providing primary and secondary healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive health support; (2) providing integrated mental health and psychosocial services; (3) providing water, sanitation and hygiene services, including distribution of hygiene kits; and (4) providing psychosocial support and specialised services to survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), including raising awareness on GBV prevention and child protection issues.</description>

    <title>Syria – Support for health 6 - 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over ten years into the conflict, an estimated 13 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance. This includes more than 2.7 Internally displaced people, many of whom live in informal and overcrowded settlements, where access to essential needs and services is inadequate. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions, and humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, the project is providing health and protection services focused on women and girls in northeast Syria. Project activities include: (1) providing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) case management and focused psychosocial support services; (2) providing cash grants for especially vulnerable protection cases; (3) training women and girls in community based psychosocial support; and (4) providing a comprehensive package of sexual and reproductive health rights medial services.</description>

    <title>Equitable Access to Inclusive Education in Crisis-Affected Regions of Cameroon</title>
    <description>The project seeks to improve schooling for children and adolescents aged 4 to 15 years, including those living with a disability, with a special focus on girls. The project targets areas affected by humanitarian crises in Cameroon’s Far North, Littoral and West regions. Project activities are aimed at those whose access to education has been severely limited by a crisis, particularly children and adolescents who have been displaced and repatriated, and those who have become refugees. Project activities include: (1) training 101 education and child protection workers on gender equality, on the rights of girls and on the rights of children living with a disability; (2) training education stakeholders on how to integrate out-of-school children into education systems, particularly girls and children living with a disability; (3) developing and implementing gender- and inclusion-sensitive school improvement plans, including the construction of latrines adapted to the specific needs of adolescent girls and children with a physical disability; and (4) training 1,344 teachers on themes related to education in emergencies, gender-based violence in schools, special education and gender-sensitive teaching practices.  The project seeks to increase the enrolment rate of girls in the targeted areas, directly affecting 77,200 girls and 2,100 children living with a disability. Boys also benefit from access to quality education.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (December 2021) include: (1) trained 863 child protection and education actors (265 women and 597 men) on inclusive education, child’s right, gender and human rights, and protection of children with disabilities; (2) trained 363 members of 20 community-based child protection networks (164 women and 199 men) on child’s right to education. Also strengthened their ability to identify and refer vulnerable out-of-school children to animators and social workers; (3) promoted and valued their efforts to sensitize parents to the importance of keeping children in school. As well, their prevention and protection actions already benefited 8,054 people, including 2,903 children (1,306 boys and 1,597 girls) and 5,151 parents (2,973 women and 2,178 men); (4) identified 420 children (195 girls and 225 boys) at risk of dropping out of school and provided them with psychosocial, medical and legal support as needed; (5) supported school reintegration (school fees and supplies for their return or stay in school). Among those children, 33 (20 girls and 13 boys) are children living with disability; (6) provided school supplies (books, pen, pencil, school bag) to 400 pupils (171 girls and 229 boys). Among these,135 children living with a disability (50 girls and 85 boys) enrolled in 25 different primary schools; (7) identified 420 children (195 girls and 225 boys) as being at risk of dropping out of school received psychosocial, medical, legal support as needed, or support for school reintegration (school fees and school supplies for their return/stay in school); (8) provided hygiene and dignity kits (including a torch and a whistle  to prevent rape and attract attention if attacked) to girls in all zones; and (9) distributed 7,936 temporary hand-washing stations, 711,000 bars of soap and 31,332 hydro-gel hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Democratic Republic of the Congo - Emergency and Medical Humanitarian Response - MSF  2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>February 2019 – From new violence in peaceful areas of the country, such as Ituri province, to multiple Ebola outbreaks, and the forced return of hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2018 has pushed the limits of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s humanitarian assistance. These challenges, coupled with cyclical violence and a lack of basic services, has exacerbated live-saving needs across the east and centre of the country. Millions of Congolese bear the brunt of this context, which is characterized by worsening inter-ethnic tensions and conflict, and where widespread human rights abuses and sexual violence are prevalent. In 2018, 1.26 million Congolese were newly displaced, and it is expected that 2019 will bring an additional 2.9 million returnees back to their areas of origin, creating significant needs in protection, livelihoods and food security. Approximately 12.8 million people are food insecure and 4.28 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders aims to help address the humanitarian and medical needs of up to 300,000 people per year in 16 provinces of the DRC. The project focuses on providing urgent lifesaving emergency preventative, primary and secondary healthcare, and, through improved surveillance, early detection of possible disease outbreaks, and quick assessment and response to disease outbreaks and medical and humanitarian emergencies.  Project activities include: (1) providing outpatient consultations to population in area of response; (2) providing testing, diagnoses and treatment of main morbidities; (3) distributing non-food item (NFI) kits including bed nets and sanitation supplies; and (4) providing individual and group counselling/mental health sessions to vulnerable groups of women, children and adolescents, including survivors of sexual and/or gender-based violence.</description>

    <title>Support to the Jordan Health Fund for Refugees - COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project supports Jordan’s Ministry of Health  through the Jordan Heath Fund for Refugees in ensuring better health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, particularly women and girls. Along with other donors, Canada's contribution offsets the additional costs of providing health services to Syrians through Jordan’s public health system. Project activities include: (1) providing primary and secondary health care services in Ministry of Health facilities; and (2) procuring medicines, medical solutions, consumables and supplies.  This multi-donor initiative expects to benefit more than 670,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. As with all pooled fund projects, Canada works in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization and strengthen mutual accountability.  This kind of assistance also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved provision of quality primary and secondary health services at Jordanian Ministry of Health facilities for Syrian refugees; and (2) expanded use of quality primary and secondary health services at Ministry of Health facilities by Syrian refugees.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2021 include: (1) the Jordan Prime Minister’s office issued a policy that allows Syrian refugees access to the Ministry of Health (MoH) services at the same rate as non-insured Jordanians. The policy to include non-Syrian refugees came into effect as of June 2020.  The new policy  circulated to relevant directorates and health facilities to ensure all staff’s awareness of the policy and its implications; (2) the production of awareness and communication materials of  the new policy and dissemination within MoH health facilities to increase access of Syrians to MoH facilities; (3) the Maternal and Child Health Directorate at MoH regularly conducted awareness activities on various health issues targeting women from the local community regardless of their nationality; (4) the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Al-Salt hospital was equipped with new incubators. This allowed MoH to accommodate the high number of children in need for NICU services among both Syrians and Jordanians and improve the quality of the provided health services; (5) The support provided through the Jordan Heath Fund for Refugees (JHFR) enabled Jordan to become one of the world’s first countries to start COVID-19 vaccinations for refugees. MoH has managed to vaccinate 424 Syrian refugees, representing approximately 11% of the total Syrians registered in the vaccination platform; (6) the JHFR Steering Committee approved a USD $10M allocation to COVID-19 response under its 2020 work plan. This COVID-19 funding helped the MoH expand its testing and case management procedures to monitor infections and provide care for the sick; and (7) the JHFR funded the construction of a new ICU building and surgical department in Al-Bashir Hospital to receive COVID-19 patients and rehabilitated isolation units in two hospitals.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>SYRIA - OCHA CBPF – 2020</title>
    <description>The humanitarian situation in Syria has continued to deteriorate as a result of the civil war in the country. An estimated 13.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 6 million internally displaced persons according to the United Nations. Years of active conflict and displacement have resulted in severe protection risks and increased vulnerability of millions of persons in Syria. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge and repeated attacks on humanitarian and medical workers continue, adding to the complexity of the humanitarian response.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is managing a Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Turkey, as well as one in Syria. These two Funds channel resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Pakistan Floods - Emergency Response - IFRC 2022</title>
    <description>September 2022 – Heavy monsoon rainfall has affected Pakistan since mid-June, causing widespread flooding that has affected 33 million. Reports indicate that multiple regions have been affected by flooding, road closures, power interruptions and disruptions to communications. To date, over 1,300 people have been killed by the floods and nearly 13,000 injured. Rapid assessments conducted by government authorities and humanitarian agencies have identified initial priority humanitarian needs as food assistance, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and healthcare. An estimated 6.4 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the floods.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are working to save lives and help reduce the suffering of people affected by flooding. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter assistance, including tents and winterization kits; (2) scaling up emergency health services, such as medical care, mental health and psychosocial support; (3) providing integrated assistance through multi-purpose cash, livelihood and shelter support; (4) supporting the procurement and mobilization of in-kind humanitarian items; and (5) ensuring the protection of vulnerable people, including through gender and inclusion programming.</description>

    <title>Supporting Elections for Ethiopia’s Democracy Strengthening (SEEDS)</title>
    <description>This project supports the conducting credible, inclusive and peaceful elections in Ethiopia in 2021. It is Canada’s contribution to the multi-laterally funded United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) electoral assistance project. The project supports the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) in the planning and delivery of the 2021 general elections. The project focuses on the belief that technically capable, independent, and trusted institutions make for the conduct of credible, inclusive and peaceful elections.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the NEBE as a cohesive institution through professional development, training, and supporting gender-sensitive reform and procedure drafting; (2) introducing and strengthening the NEBE’s various systems, procedures, standards, tools, and protocols; (3) building staff capacities related to electoral processes; (4) building NEBE capacities for transparent and timely communication with the electorate; and (5) building NEBE capacities for detecting and resolving election-related disputes. The project’s strategic approach is to support the NEBE in ensuring inclusive participation of all groups, including women, youth, and ethnic groups from all regions.</description>

    <title>Economic Growth and Entrepreneurial Skills Development for Women</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the sustainable economic empowerment of women leaders of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and associations in Sucre, Colombia, through the Economic Growth and Entrepreneurial Skills Development for Women (C.R.E.C.E Mujer). It seeks to increase their income and strengthen their entrepreneurial skills while increasing their self-confidence as sustainable business leaders (ultimate outcome: 1000). To contribute to this sustainability, the École des Entrepreneurs du Québec (ÉEQ) plans to strengthen the capacities of the following 12 organizations that support entrepreneurship: the Sucre Governor’s office, Sincelejo city hall, the Sincelejo chamber of commerce, Incubar SUCRE (business incubator), SENA (national apprenticeship service), women’s associations (ANMUCNISUC, ROSMUD'S, AMARS, Vive Mujer), the foundation Fundación Hijos de la Sierra Flor, the organization Diakonía para la Paz, and Parquesoft.  The project started during the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed some activities. There have been 2 requests for extensions and changes to budget lines. Following Global Affairs Canada's approval of all extension requests, they postponed the end of the project activities to March 31, 2023, and the end of the project agreement to June 30, 2023.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved prevention and response to gender-based violence (GBV) against women and girls provided by responsive institutions; (2) increased public awareness of the importance of ending GBV in Tunisia; and (3) increased resilience of marginalized women and girls affected by GBV.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2023 include: (1) trained 35 senior civil servants, including 26 women and gender focal points, from seven ministries. This training improved their knowledge of how to plan and implement public policies that take gender equality into account; (2) trained 40 civil servants from the Ministry of the Interior in handling cases of violence against women. This training focused on knowledge of the legal framework, the rights of women victims of violence and best practices for dealing with women and children who are victims of cyber-violence; (3) enhanced the capacities of 45 senior civil servants, including 10 men and 35 women, who deepened their understanding of gender-responsive budgeting (GRB). The training notably enhanced their ability to prepare sectoral action plans for gender mainstreaming and institutionalization and to promote gender equality at all levels of the public budgeting process. During this training, they developed gender-sensitive budgeting sheets explaining how to integrate gender into ministerial budgeting processes; and (4) accompanied 250 women artisans spread over six governorates: Tataouine, Médenine, Gabès, Gafsa, Tozeur, and Kébili. This enabled them to move upmarket and diversify their outlets while highlighting the cultural value of their products as part of their ancestral heritage.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Improving Gender Equality, Waste Management and Clean Energy in Haiti</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the well-being of the population of the commune of Gonaïves in Haiti. The project aims to incorporate waste management by allowing the sale of carbon credits and the production of green energy through the recovery of biogas produced by decomposing waste. Ultimately, this allows waste management operations to be self-funded.  Project activities include: (1) completing technical studies and installing the first biomethanation plant; (2) closing the current informal landfill site and reintegrating disadvantaged people and women into society through recycling and waste-collection activities; (3) establishing a contract for the sale of electricity and carbon credits; (4) implementing an extensive program to raise awareness about sanitation and the sound management of waste and the environment; (5) implementing vocational training in waste collection and landfill management; and (6) establishing a team of waste collection and recycling operators.  Biothermica works in partnership with BioEnergie Haïti and Terres des Jeunes Internationales to implement waste management activities and advocacy and awareness campaigns. It also planned for the project to call on external investors to fund the construction of the biocells and alternative energy sources to ensure long-term viability.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) empowering women within BioÉnergie Haïti and its local partners; (2) improving waste management in a financially viable manner by the people of Gonaïves through BioÉnergie Haïti (the project will create a new landfill site and generate income from the biogas produced in the form of credits and electricity); and (3) increasing the equitable participation of the people of Gonaïves in the waste collection system.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December, 2023) include: (1) established collection routes covering a perimeter of 13. 6 km across Gonaïves, with a theoretical waste collection rate of 95% achieved (actual rate following construction of the new site and bio-cells); (2) acquired land ownership enabling completion of the environmental assessment; (3) hired 3 women in permanent management and decision-making positions within BioÉnergie Haïti; (4) trained and temporarily employed by BioÉnergie Haïti, to carry out the awareness and clean-up campaigns, 302 precarious people, including 230 women and 72 men; (5) 140,000 members of the Gonaïves community participated in the various awareness and clean-up campaigns; and (6) Biothermica and BioÉnergie Haïti updated and adopted the following new internal policies and procedures: prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, fight against fraud and corruption, code of conduct and professional ethics (updated), prevention of psychological or sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and gender equality, inclusion and diversity.  Due to difficulties in obtaining additional investment for the construction of the bio-cells and the new waste treatment plant, the project was unable to go ahead with the closure of the illegal landfill. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining external funding led to an early and responsible closure of the project.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Global disease surveillance: health, security and law enforcement alignment</title>
    <description>This project aims to address the lack of disease surveillance for law enforcement. It does so by providing an in-depth feasibility assessment related to developing a security-centric biological surveillance system for the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to detect early and prevent bioterrorism. Project activities include: (1) developing baseline situational reports summarizing existing global biosecurity threats; (2) developing guidance documents for law enforcement agencies identifying environmental and other risk factors that could impact the relevance of particular diseases to international security; (3) delivery of a needs-based analysis to identify INTERPOL’s reporting and communication needs; and (4) development of a technical prototype of the proposed surveillance platform.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) enhanced awareness by INTERPOL of local, regional and global biological threats; (2) strengthened capacity of law enforcement agencies to target interventions to counter the impacts of biological threats; and (3) enhanced awareness by INTERPOL of the international impact of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security threats.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2021  include: (1) integrated 8 customizations into the BlueDot Insight platform to fit the International Criminal Police Organization’s (INTERPOL) needs; (2) trained 5 INTERPOL analysts and provided access to the BlueDot platform; and (3) produced and submitted 25 threat assessment reports to INTERPOL, which determined that the BlueDot platform could be adapted for law enforcement needs.</resultsAchieved>
