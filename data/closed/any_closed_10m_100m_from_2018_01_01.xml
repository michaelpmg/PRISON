    <title>We Decide - Reducing Adolescent Pregnancy in Loreto, Peru</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for adolescent girls in the Amazon province of Loreto, Peru, which has the highest rate of adolescent pregnancy in the country (31% in 2016). By empowering girls and working with boys and communities, the project helps prevent sexual violence and unwanted pregnancies in one of the poorest regions of Peru.  Project activities include: (1) training, workshops and coaching activities with adolescents and youth in coordination with schools, community leaders and families; (2) development and distribution of information on adolescents’ SRHR as part of a comprehensive communication strategy; (3) training of health workers and creation of specialised health facilities to improve sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents; (4) training of teachers, tutors and local Ministry of Education staff on comprehensive sexual education for adolescents, including the prevention of violence; and (5) training of youth leaders and networks to increase their capacity to participate in municipal, regional and national decision-making spaces. Project activities are intended to reach 78,000 direct beneficiaries, many of whom are from indigenous communities.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved agency of adolescent girls over their own Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH), including utilization of SRH services to prevent early pregnancy; (2) improved delivery of gender-responsive and adolescent-friendly SRH services and Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) to adolescent girls and boys; and (3) enhanced district and regional institutional responsiveness to the SRHR of adolescents, with a particular focus on girls.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (September 2023) include: (1) increased the percentage of adolescent girls (aged 12 to 17 years) who feel confident in their ability to refuse unwanted sex from 44.1% at baseline to 71.6% at endline; (2) increased the percentage of adolescent participants with adequate access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) resources and services, including modern contraceptive methods. For adolescent girls, it increased from 27.3% to 41.4.1% and for adolescent boys, from 35.9 % to 56.3.7%; (3) increased the level of gender responsiveness of SRHR services in targeted health facilities from 48.6/100 at baseline to 72.9/100 at endline; and (4) increased the percentage of municipal plans including actions on SRHR, from 44.7% at baseline to 68.1% at endline.  The project impacted the lives of 95,744 participants, including adolescents, youth, parents, community members and leaders, teachers, health personnel, and civilian servants.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Supporting Family Planning and Abortion in Mozambique</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve gender equality in nine districts in Manica and Tete provinces such that adolescent girls and young women can exercise their rights to autonomy and self-determination over their own body, as well as to sexual and reproductive health.  Project activities include: (1) conducting outreach, training and small group mentoring of adolescent girls and young women to increase their confidence, knowledge, skills and civic action on sexual and reproductive health; (2) establishing community feedback and accountability mechanisms on quality of health services and progress on gender equality; (3) facilitating community dialogues for young and older men to increase their engagement and responsibility and develop action plans on sexual and reproductive health, gender violence, early marriage, and gender equality; (4) training community healthcare workers who counsel family members on the harmful effects of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage; (5) broadcasting radio shows that address harmful and discriminatory norms about sexual and reproductive health; (6) establishing services for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and psychological support; (7) training and mentoring health providers and managers to offer quality, safe and legal contraceptive and abortion services; and (8) conducting outreach to provide family planning and other sexual and reproductive health services and referrals to the most remote populations.</description>

    <title>Preventing and Responding to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia</title>
    <description>The project aims to advance the empowerment of women and girls by preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Ethiopia. The project includes activities to support women and girls in reaching their full potential and meeting their sexual and reproductive health needs, free from violence, harmful traditional practices, exploitation and discrimination. Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness on SGBV, including harmful traditional practices, as well as on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) with communities, local authorities, vulnerable households, and change agents such as traditional leaders; (2) training psycho-social counsellors and health personnel, including government health workers, on gender-responsive SGBV services; (3) establishing or strengthening model clinics, safe houses and one-stop centres to provide comprehensive and integrated services on SGBV and SRHR; and (4) training and technical support to improve the implementation of relevant legal and policy frameworks around SGBV and SRHR, for instance for law enforcement bodies. The project focuses on 8 regions across Ethiopia, targeting 14 million people.</description>

    <title>Sustainable Remediation in Ready-made Garments</title>
    <description>This multi-donor project supports the development of the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh that employs over 4 million people and is a key contributor to Bangladesh’s economic growth. Designed to drive up the quality of jobs, the project takes a coordinated approach to addressing long-standing challenges facing Bangladesh’s ready-made garment industry and to securing lasting improvements in garment factory working conditions. The project focuses particular attention on improving gender equality and empowerment of women, who constitute 70% of the garment sector workforce and face significant gender equality challenges, including gender segregation, wage differentials, low literacy rates, lack of maternity protection, sexual harassment and gender-based violence, and lack of awareness and advocacy on women’s rights.  Project activities include: (1) providing technical support for the timely remediation of 1,500 factories; (2) strengthening government capacity to better regulate industrial safety and establish an effective and gender-sensitive labour inspection system; (3) supporting the development of inclusive occupational safety and health policies and practices; and (4) implementing a scaled-up Better Work Program in Bangladesh, to improve garment sector compliance with international labour standards and competitiveness in global markets.</description>

    <title>Combatting Early Marriage in Bangladesh</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce child, early and forced marriage in the Bhola and Jhalokati districts of Bangladesh. It also aims to reduce the vulnerability and poverty of adolescents in these two districts with a focus on reducing the proportion of girls under 18 years of age that are married.  Bangladesh has one of the highest child marriage rates in the world. Approximately 52% of girls in Bangladesh are married by their 18th birthday, and 18% by the age of 15. Bhola and Jhalokati districts are among the poorest districts in Bangladesh and have the highest rates of child marriage in the country. Project activities include: (1) raising awareness and engaging adolescents, especially girls, in life skills education such as financial literacy and vocational abilities; (2) mobilizing community stakeholders by encouraging open, inclusive and informed discussions on the harmful impact of child marriage; and (3) strengthening existing child protection mechanisms.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include : (1) increased agency of adolescent girls and boys to protect themselves from harmful gender norms and practices, including child, early and forced marriage, and exercise choice in economic opportunities and decisions about their futures; (2) improved community acceptance of norms that value girls and actions that support delayed marriage; and (3) increased responsiveness of duty-bearers (such as matchmakers and marriage registrars) at national and sub-national levels to prevent and respond to child rights violations.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2023 include: (1) trained 8,000 adolescent students on life skills, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), and combatting child marriages; (2) trained 1,760 secondary school teachers on gender equity and adolescent SRHR to effectively teach their students about these topics; (3) trained 71,729 students from 440 schools and madrasas (Islamic religious schools)  on gender equity and adolescent SRHR; (4) 80,108 parents (40,144 fathers and 39,964 mothers) participated in group sessions aimed at changing attitudes and norms around gender equity and combatting child marriages; (5) trained 1,358 matchmakers and individuals involved in registering marriages on existing laws against child marriages, leading to increased awareness of gender equality, girls’ rights and harmful social norms; and (6) the community celebrated 527 girl child births. Before the project, the birth of a girl was not a cause for celebration.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Sexual and Reproductive Health for Women and Adolescents in Northern Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project aims to empower women and adolescent girls in targeted northern communities of Nigeria to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health. Project activities include: (1) training and mentoring small drug stores and pharmacies to provide youth-friendly gender-sensitive family planning services including counselling, provision of a minimum of five contraceptive products, including birth control injectable shots, and health care referrals; (2) recruiting, training and mentoring a rural women family planning sales force for family planning products; (3) training and mentoring health care workers on the provision of sexual and reproductive health counselling and services, including long-acting reversible contraceptives and postpartum services; (4) developing gender-sensitive demand-generation strategies for increasing awareness and adoption of family planning services among women and adolescent girls and boys in both rural and urban settings and in and out-of- school settings; (5) developing and implementing a community engagement strategy targeting religious, traditional, community opinion leaders and men to support women’s reproductive health rights and empowerment; and (6) strengthening the family planning supply chain and implementing an advocacy strategy to increase funding commitments by states towards reliable sexual and reproductive health commodity procurement and distribution. The project is expected to reach an estimated 2.6 million women of reproductive age, of which approximately one million are between 10 and 24 years of age.</description>

    <title>Reaching and Empowering Adolescents to Make Informed Choices on Sexual and Reproductive Health</title>
    <description>The project enables adolescents to better exercise their reproductive rights, as well as make informed choices on their sexual and reproductive health. An innovative community-based model is used to promote positive gender norms among adolescents and their families.  Project activities include: (1) training public health workers and private sector providers on gender-sensitive and adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services delivery, including family planning, contraceptives, post-abortion care, and sexual and gender-based violence; and establishing and operating gender-sensitive, adolescent-friendly safe spaces in health facilities to deliver SRHR services to adolescent boys and girls; (2) training community change agents (including religious and traditional leaders) to raise awareness in a gender-sensitive manner on SRHR, and promote safe space activities for adolescent girls and boys, partners, parents and community members; and (3) supporting advocacy and coalition building between youth advocacy forums and like-minded organizations, including women’s rights organizations, to advocate for improved SRHR services within their communities. The project is expected to reach approximately 100,000 married and unmarried adolescents, including 55,000 very young adolescents aged 10 to 14 directly, and an additional 400,000 community members indirectly.</description>

    <expectedResults>The project’s expected results include: (1) improved access to quality gender-sensitive and adolescent-friendly public and private sector sexual and reproductive health and rights services for unmarried and married adolescent girls and boys; (2) increased capacity of married and unmarried adolescent girls to make decisions about their own sexual and reproductive health and rights; and (3) increased capacity of youth-focused civil society groups, including women’s rights organizations, to advocate and integrate evidenced-based best practices in adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights services in state policies and programmes.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (August 2021) include :(1) reached 182,246 beneficiaries (of whom 53% are women) and indirectly reached 556,655 beneficiaries (of whom 49% are women). This contributed to improving the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Nigeria; (2) improved access of 100,000 married and unmarried adolescents to high-quality, gender-responsive and adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health services; (3) improved the quality of sexual and reproductive health services by training 293 health workers (292 women and one man) on delivering gender-sensitive adolescent sexual and reproductive health services. This includes family planning, post-abortion care, and long-acting reversible contraception; and (4) strengthened health systems in all three states (Gombe, Katsina, and Zamfara) by contributing to the development and dissemination of health policies such as the National Adolescent Health and Development Policy (2021-2025) and the Gender in Health Policy (2021-2025).</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Improving Integrated Health Services for Women, Teenage Girls and Children in Haiti</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health of women and teenage girls, as well as the health of newborns and children in the two departments of Haiti’s Grand Sud region that were most affected by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. It is strengthening 28 health institutions by, among other things, repairing infrastructure, providing equipment and medicines and training staff. By improving access to and quality of integrated health services focused on the needs of women and adolescent girls, the project aims to reduce teenage pregnancies by 75% and provide access to 72,000 more women to a modern contraceptive method. The project also aims to strengthen the Haitian government's capacities in health sector management, coordination and monitoring at the central and departmental levels.  It is estimated that, every year, approximately 15,400 pregnant women, 3,000 women who are potential victims of gender based violence and 3,400 children are to benefit from the services provided by the health institutions supported by the project.</description>

    <title>Global Financing Facility: Advancing Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to family planning, for women and girls of reproductive age in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. This is done through Global Financing Facility (GFF) support to country implementation plans. The GFF is a multi-donor financing platform that provides country-led, sustainable financing. The support includes technical assistance to develop national health plans which support sexual and reproductive health and rights, including strengthening supply chains and procurement to ensure women and girls have access to modern contraceptives. Project activities include: (1) providing financing for quality sexual and reproductive health products and services; (2) encouraging both countries to improve equity and remove barriers to access services; and (3) providing women and girls access to a range of contraceptive options.</description>

    <title>Supporting Women's Resilience in Crisis in Lebanon</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to the economic empowerment of Lebanese women and Syrian refugee women in Lebanon. This project is part of the UNDP’s Lebanon Host Communities Support Programme (LHSP), a national initiative launched jointly with Lebanon’s Ministry of Social Affairs as a comprehensive response to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and its implications on Lebanon.  The project supports women-led businesses and women to actively participate in the local economy, and strengthens the role that local authorities (such as municipalities, municipal unions and local economic development organizations) play in advancing women’s economic empowerment in Lebanon.  Project activities include: (1) providing training, paid internships, coaching and mentoring to Lebanese women and Syrian refugee women to strengthen their abilities to integrate into the economic sphere; (2) offering training, mentoring, marketing and financial support services to women-led businesses in order to improve their productivity and competitiveness; (3) organizing advocacy and awareness-raising activities to strengthen public support of women’s economic empowerment and reduce social barriers; and (4) providing technical, strategic and management training and support to municipalities to better mainstream gender considerations into economic development strategies and interventions.  The project is expected to reach 103,000 individuals through training, direct services and awareness campaigns, and to create or maintain up to 700 jobs.</description>

    <title>Market-based Opportunities and Skills Training for Women and Youth in Lebanon</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the livelihoods of Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian women and youth between the ages of 15 and 34 in Lebanon, contribute to women’s empowerment, and strengthen the resilience of individuals, communities and systems to withstand regional crises and stimulate economic development. Growth that works for everyone is fostered by working towards equal participation of women in the Lebanese economy, specifically through skills training and support, technical assistance to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to develop their business and create employment opportunities and by supporting businesses in providing services assisting women’s participation in the workforce. This project links youth and women to market-driven skills training, in partnership with the private sector to connect youth with employment opportunities. The project also helps entrepreneurs by providing technical assistance or in-kind support packages to accelerate growth and foster merit-based hiring practices. Training and/or business coaching is also provided to potential start-ups to help create employment. The project supports businesses in developing gender-inclusive practices to increase the hiring and retention of women. Additionally, an analysis of the barriers impeding women and girls from accessing skills and job opportunities is also conducted. The project identifies services that enable women and youth to overcome barriers to employment (such as daycare and transportation), and helps develop them. To address barriers that prevent women from taking an active economic role, the project is underpinned by community outreach to increase support for enhancing the skills of women and girls, and their expanded participation in the workforce.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) women and youth are gainfully employed or self-employed; (2) MSMEs and start-ups improve their capacity to develop their businesses and hire women and youth; and (3) women and youth have a supportive enabling environment for their economic activities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) placed 743 individuals (53% women) into paid jobs after training. This includes 67% full-time, 25% part-time, and 8% seasonal or short-term positions. Also supported 140 businesses (52% women-led) by providing technical assistance, machinery, and tools to expand their operations, resulting in creating 318 new jobs (56% filled by women), with 177 being full-time, 98 seasonal, and 43 part-time positions; (2) assisted 58 businesses in implementing measures to hire and retain women and youth employees. These measures include offering flexible working hours and equitable salaries. They also enhanced the technical, soft, and employability skills of 1,364 individuals (59% women) through 101 market-based vocational training courses. As a result, 791 individuals (48% women) enhanced their practical skills through a work-based learning program. Also provided 228 entrepreneurs (142 women) with entrepreneurship training, leading to 75 of them (42 women) starting their businesses after graduation; and (3) supported 620 individuals (407 women) in networking and mentoring opportunities, strengthening professional relationships and expanding networks. They engaged 185 mentors (71% women) from 16 organizations in the public, private, and civil society sectors to mentor 620 mentees (66% women) to build their networks and reinforce professional relationships. Also engaged 910 community members (468 women) in 29 community initiatives organized by 4 local networks to address barriers preventing women and youth from joining the workforce.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Strengthening the Midwifery Profession and Practice in Haïti</title>
    <description>The project seeks to help reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Haiti by improving the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls in four of the country’s underserved departments (Grande Anse, Sud-Est, Nippes and Nord-Ouest). In addition to addressing gender inequality, the project is helping to build women’s and girls’ capacity to make more informed choices when exercising their sexual and reproductive rights. Project activities include: (1) training midwives at the Institut national supérieur de formation des sages-femmes (INSFSF) - the national midwifery training institute - and in two new satellite/practice schools; (2) deploying these newly trained midwives to improve the range and quality of services, as well as to spur demand for these services through a community approach; (3) strengthening the legal framework of the midwifery profession, particularly by regulating the profession in accordance with international standards. The project is expected to directly benefit 205,014 women and girls, 170,266 of which are women of childbearing age and 34,749 of whom are girls aged between 10 and 14 .</description>

    <title>Support to Jordan Health Fund for Refugees</title>
    <description>This project supports Jordan’s Ministry of Health  through the Jordan Heath Fund for Refugees in ensuring better health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, particularly women and girls. Along with other donors, Canada's contribution offsets the additional costs of providing health services to Syrians through Jordan’s public health system. Project activities include: (1) providingprimary and secondary health care services in Ministry of Health facilities; and (2) procuring medicines, medical solutions, consumables and supplies.  This multi-donor initiative expects to benefit more than 670,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. As with all pooled fund projects, Canada works in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization and strengthen mutual accountability.  This kind of assistance also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved provision of quality primary and secondary health services at Jordanian Ministry of Health facilities for Syrian refugees and; (2) expanded use of quality primary and secondary health services at Ministry of Health facilities by Syrian refugees.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2021 include: (1) the Jordan Prime Minister’s office issued a policy that allows Syrian refugees access to the Ministry of Health (MoH) services at the same rate as non-insured Jordanians. The policy to include non-Syrian refugees came into effect as of June 2020.  The new policy  circulated to relevant directorates and health facilities to ensure all staff’s awareness of the policy and its implications; (2) the production of awareness and communication materials of  the new policy and dissemination within MoH health facilities to increase access of Syrians to MoH facilities; (3) the Maternal and Child Health Directorate at MoH regularly conducted awareness activities on various health issues targeting women from the local community regardless of their nationality; (4) the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Al-Salt hospital was equipped with new incubators. This allowed MoH to accommodate the high number of children in need for NICU services among both Syrians and Jordanians and improve the quality of the provided health services; (5) The support provided through the Jordan Heath Fund for Refugees (JHFR) enabled Jordan to become one of the world’s first countries to start COVID-19 vaccinations for refugees. MoH has managed to vaccinate 424 Syrian refugees, representing approximately 11% of the total Syrians registered in the vaccination platform; (6) the JHFR Steering Committee approved a USD $10M allocation to COVID-19 response under its 2020 work plan. This COVID-19 funding helped the MoH expand its testing and case management procedures to monitor infections and provide care for the sick; and (7) the JHFR funded the construction of a new ICU building and surgical department in Al-Bashir Hospital to receive COVID-19 patients and rehabilitated isolation units in two hospitals.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Humanitarian Pooled Funds - OCHA 2018</title>
    <description>May 2018 – The humanitarian situation in Syria has continued to deteriorate as a result of the civil war in the country. An estimated 13.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 6 million internally displaced persons according to the United Nations. Years of active conflict and displacement have resulted in severe protection risks and increased vulnerability of millions of persons in Syria. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge and repeated attacks on humanitarian and medical workers continue, adding to the complexity of the humanitarian response.  With GAC’s support, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is managing a Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Turkey, as well as one in Syria. These two Funds channel resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.</description>

    <title>Emergency Disaster Assistance Fund - Canadian Red Cross 2018-2022</title>
    <description>The Emergency Disaster Assistance Fund project supports a draw-down fund, administered by the Canadian Red Cross, which allows Canada to rapidly respond to International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) emergency operations following small- and medium-scale humanitarian crises. The draw-down fund is a flexible funding mechanism that supports a timely and effective humanitarian response to those affected by natural disasters or complex emergencies, including conflict, population movement, food insecurity, and health crises.  This project also supports the IFRC’s pilot Forecast-Based Action Mechanism. Triggered by forecasts such as weather patterns or precipitation levels, the mechanism disburses funding to local Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies to take early action and put in place preparedness measures in the early stages of a disaster, to reduce the impact on local populations.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Coalition - Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund, Phase III - 2019-2020</title>
    <description>The Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund (CHAF), managed by the Humanitarian Coalition (HC), supports timely and reliable humanitarian assistance to those affected by rapid-onset, small- and medium-scale disasters in developing countries. Through the CHAF, funds are allocated to the Humanitarian Coalition member best placed to respond to a particular emergency. The Humanitarian Coalition is made up of seven Canadian non-governmental organizations: Canadian Lutheran World Relief, CARE Canada, Islamic Relief Canada, Oxfam Canada, Oxfam-Québec, Plan Canada and Save the Children Canada.  In the second phase of the project, CHAF supported 40 projects by member organizations to respond to sudden-onset small-scale disasters in a timely manner. This two-year, third phase of the CHAF continues to finance responses to smaller-scale disasters where there are unmet humanitarian needs and gaps in the humanitarian response. The project also allows for responses to medium-scale disasters.  With GAC's support, the CHAF is: (1) promoting early actions and responses to reduce loss of life; (2) improving the speed of emergency responses; and (3) supporting live-saving activities such as health care, protection services, and emergency shelter, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene services.</description>

    <title>Promoting the Economic Resilience of Syrian Women (PERSEVERE)</title>
    <description>This project provides support in targeted areas of Syria to: (1) improve women’s livelihoods; (2) build the capacity of local women’s organizations to actively participate in community-level economic decision-making; and (3) promulgate approaches to local economic planning that are more inclusive of gender, age and disability considerations. This project also raises the awareness of affected communities about explosive remnants of war (ERWs) that impede sustainable livelihoods. This is done by providing educational sessions related to the identification of explosive hazards and helping affected communities develop protective measures.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) women, including young and older women, as well as women with disabilities, participate more actively and effectively in the local economy and economic decision-making in their communities; and (2) community members and organizations actively support the inclusion of gender, age and disability considerations in community-level economic decision-making.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (September 2022) include : (1) provided technical andfinancial support to 349 women-led businesses, groups and organizations (24 of which  led by women with disabilities) .  65% of surveyed beneficiries reported that they could meaningfully participate in formal or informal decision-making related to economic governance at the community level. They also reported an increase of 40%  in their contribution to the average household income after participating in project activities; and (2) engaged 37,859 community members (19,190 women and 18,669 men), including 48 women and 24 men with disabilities, in discussions and promote gender, age and disability (GAD) inclusion in livelihoods at the household- and community level.  50% of community members, households and local institution representatives surveyed reported having taken action to reduce GAD inclusion barriers in the past six months. 181,330 community members (93,559 women and 87,771 men), including 376 women and 349 men with disabilities, received risk education sessions on explosive hazards and safe behaviours to prevent and respond to COVID-19.  92% of survey respondents said they adopted safe behaviours towards explosive hazards and the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 after the training.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Emergency Assistance - Regional-Level Funding for Africa, Americas and Asia - UNHCR 2019</title>
    <description>March 2019 – The Africa region continues to accommodate the largest population of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worldwide, with more than 24 million people of concern. The Asia and Pacific region is home to nearly 9.5 million people of concern to the UNHCR, and the Americas includes close to 10 million persons of concern. The UNHCR provides international protection and assistance to the world’s refugees, stateless persons, asylum seekers, and in some instances, internally-displaced persons and searches for lasting solutions to their situations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, UNCHR is helping provide assistance and protection to refugees, internally-displaced persons and other persons of concern in Africa, the Americas and Asia in ODA-eligible countries. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation and health services, including reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; (4) providing protection against sexual and gender-based violence, and for children; (5) working with governments to register asylum seekers and refugees, and helping issue identity documents; (6) working with governments to support refugee self-reliance and forge peaceful relations between refugees and local citizens; and (7) expanding opportunities for durable solutions for people of concern.</description>

    <title>Emergency Regional Funding for the Middle East -  ICRC Appeals 2019-2021</title>
    <description>July 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and humanitarian needs are acute for refugees facing protracted displacement in Jordan and Lebanon.  In line with Grand Bargain commitments, GAC is providing flexible regional funding to the ICRC on a multiyear basis, for its emergency operations in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Regional funding provides the ICRC with the flexibility to allocate funds to acute humanitarian needs that are critically underfunded, and provides the flexibility to respond to emerging needs. Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise to strengthen their capacity in areas such as promoting international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and delivering relief in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees.</description>

    <title>Multi-Country Emergency Food Assistance in the Middle East - WFP 2019-2021</title>
    <description>June 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and refugees facing protracted displacement in host countries continue to face acute humanitarian needs in Jordan and Lebanon.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the World Food Programme (WFP) is providing food assistance to more than 7 million people facing malnutrition and severe food insecurity in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. WFP is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future. In the four countries, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) supplementary feeding for children under the age of five years old, as well as for pregnant and lactating women; (3) establishing emergency school feeding programs; (4) supplying vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) providing food for work.  The project is expected to provide emergency food assistance to more than seven million people affected by malnutrition and acute food insecurity in the four countries.</description>

    <title>Reducing child, early and forced marriage in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone</title>
    <description>The project aims to reduce the prevalence of child early and forced marriage (CEFM) in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone. It works to reduce CEFM by enabling girls to decide their own futures and fulfill their equal human rights.  Project activities include: (1) establishing/refurbishing physical safe spaces in existing community structures and equipping them with age-appropriate materials; (2) identifying female and male gender equality (GE) community champions using a participatory approach; and (3) conducting dialogue workshops between trained Civil Society organizations (CSOs) and government officials to understand the issues and challenges in addressing CEFM.  It is expected the project reaches over 25,900 direct beneficiaries (11,400 girls, 6,700 boys, 3,800 women, 4,000 men) in the Western Area Rural and the Kailahun Districts of Sierra Leone, and the Cascades and Hauts-Bassins regions of Burkina Faso. Key groups include girls, boys, women, men, traditional and religious leaders, women- and girl-led community groups, Civil Society organizations, service providers, sub-national, national, and regional government stakeholders.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) empowered adolescent girls and boys between the ages of 12 and 17, including those most marginalized, are able to make informed decisions about marriage and pregnancy; (2) improved social environment for adolescent girls and boys between the ages of 12 and 17, including those most marginalized, to make their own decisions around marriage and pregnancy; and (3) strengthened institutional environment for accelerated action on GE and CEFM prevention.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2024)  include: (1) established 30 safe spaces in Burkina Faso and 60 in Sierra Leone for training in and out of school children in positive life skills, gender norms and sexual and reproductive health (SRH);  (2) trained 215 facilitators (116 women and 99 men), reached 9,103 adolescent girls of ages 10 to 18 years and 6,248 adolescent boys of ages 10 to 18 years; (3) trained 5,530 out-of-school youth, including married adolescent girls  and boys (2,889), on financial literacy through participation in village savings and loans associations (VSLAs). VSLAs contributed to reducing gender-based violence incidents, better decision-making on marriage and family planning and improved household chore distribution; (4) trained 1,080 gender equality champions (90 women and 990 men), also delivered programs to promote gender equality, and increased agency of adolescent girls, women (23,992) and men (20,005) caregivers of adolescents; (5) trained health and protection service providers (259 women and 225 men) on gender equality responsive and adolescent friendly service delivery; and (6) through 26 workshops, researchers disseminated results of a study on gender responsiveness of approaches to influence social and gender norms around child early and forced marriage (CEFM) to government officials and community members, including adolescents (615 girls and 576 boys) to accelerate political commitments to prevent CEFM.  The project experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing inflation, food insecurity, and the threat of harmful coping mechanisms of adolescent girls and boys. Conflict and political upheaval in Burkina Faso also affected the project.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Addressing Barriers to Education</title>
    <description>This project aims to support a range of countries experiencing fragility, conflict, and violence to improve the quality and gender-responsiveness of their education systems and better address the health-related barriers that impede girls’ and adolescent girls’ access to quality education and learning, including for those with disabilities. This project is implemented by the World Bank in collaboration with the Global Financing Facility (GFF). The GFF is a multi-donor financing platform that provides country-led, sustainable financing for health, nutrition and education.  Addressing education and learning challenges in countries facing fragility, conflict, and violence requires building on the inherent linkages between education and health. Access to school, quality instruction and learning materials are necessary but insufficient to achieve good learning outcomes. Children and adolescents need to be healthy to take full advantage of the education opportunities provided, and education is a key determinant of health outcomes. As a result of poor health, children miss an estimated 500 million days of school in low- and lower-middle income countries each year.  This project supports GFF countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence to improve education outcomes for girls and adolescent girls by:  1. Reducing health-related barriers that impede access for girls to education: Efforts to reduce barriers focus on scaling up the delivery of health programs in schools that target girls and adolescent girls with a package of health and nutrition services that have been demonstrated to reduce health-related barriers to education and improve enrollment, attendance and retention. Health interventions include for example, school-based malaria prevention, feeding/micronutrient supplementation, vaccinations, deworming, vision screening, and comprehensive sexuality education. These efforts can improve child and adult survival, reduce early and mistimed pregnancy, reduce childhood stunting, improve access to quality and equitable primary and secondary education, and strengthen the foundational skills necessary to enter and adapt to an evolving workforce.  2. Investing in coordinated, innovative, quality gender-responsive education systems: Countries benefiting from this project who commit to allocating a portion of their World Bank financing (loans from the International Development Association (IDA)) to education priorities in their county unlock GFF Trust Fund resources at a set ratio of 5 to 1. For example, $50 million of IDA loans allocated to education unlocks $10 million from the GFF Trust Fund. This financing from IDA and GFF is used to support various initiatives, for example: efforts to expand access to free or low-cost education opportunities for girls and adolescent girls; re-entry and technical and vocational training for young mothers; efforts to combat child marriage; gender-sensitive teacher training; conditional cash transfers to boost school attendance rates amongst girls; menstrual hygiene management; and investments in systems to support improved technical efficiency and quality in the educational system including efforts to strengthen administrative data systems and performance management practices, and other efforts to improve school accountability to learners and communities.</description>

    <title>Multi-Country - UNICEF Humanitarian Appeals for the Middle East 2019-2021</title>
    <description>July 2019 - Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and refugees facing protracted displacement in host countries continue to face acute humanitarian needs in Jordan and Lebanon.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aims to  save lives, protect the rights, and meet the needs of the most vulnerable people, including children, adolescent girls and women in Iraq, Jordan Lebanon and Syria. Project activities include: (1) providing people with access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; (2) treating children for severe acute malnutrition; (3) providing emergency education programming for children; (4) ensuring protection services for children, adolescent girls and women; and (5) providing basic healthcare.</description>

    <title>Comprehensive Health and Protection Services to Conflict-Affected Populations in Syria</title>
    <description>January 2020 – The ongoing crisis in Syria continues to be a driver of displacement and humanitarian needs throughout the country. Over 9 years into the conflict, an estimate 11 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 5 million people are facing acute humanitarian needs, and millions remain displaced internally and throughout the region. Years of active conflict and displacement have exacerbated protection risks and increased vulnerability for millions. Humanitarian access to those most in need remains a significant challenge.  With GAC’s support, this project works to provide comprehensive health (including sexual and reproductive health) and protection services to up to 230,000 persons. Project activities include: (1) provision of primary and secondary healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive health, to women, men, girls and boys; (2) provision of integrated mental health and psychosocial case management services; (3) provision of gender-responsive psychosocial support services to affected populations, including survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and vulnerable populations; and (4) raising awareness on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and available services.</description>

    <title>Supporting Leadership, School Retention and the Achievement of Adolescent Girls in Senegal</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to the leadership, retention and success of adolescent girls at the middle and general secondary levels through the integration of gender and child protection in the performance management of institutions and school actors in Senegal. It aims to support the creation of a protective environment for girls, promoting their academic and professional orientation, and to put in place incentives, such as performance contracts including gender indicators, for better accountability for the performance of actors in the education system.  Project activities include the following: (1) supporting educational institutions to include gender in performance management; (2) providing support to educational stakeholders (teachers, institutions, decentralized structures) to make them aware of gender and the protection of adolescent girls in the school system; (3) developing performance contracts and tools for planning, monitoring and managing the performance of educational institutions to integrate the protection approach for adolescent girls in the school system; (4) ensuring awareness among community stakeholders and families on the issues of gender, health and the protection of adolescent girls in the school system, and of encouraging their educational and professional direction; and (5) developing necessary teaching aids.  The project aims to reach 25,000 adolescent girls at the middle and secondary levels, 3,000 professionals in decentralized structures, 640 officers in educational institutions, 1,600 professors and 480 community stakeholders.</description>

    <title>Eleventh Replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development 2019-2021</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to the eleventh replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). IFAD uses these funds and other donor funding to achieve its mandate. IFAD’s mandate is to enable poor rural people to achieve food security and access safe, sufficient and nutritious food, and overcome poverty. They aim to provide special attention to women, youth and Indigenous peoples as key beneficiaries and full partners. IFAD provides grants and low-interest loans to developing countries to support programmes and projects that promote agricultural growth and inclusive rural transformation. Activities financed through the fund focus on helping poor rural people improve their production and productivity and build their capacity. It also includes connecting them to markets and services so they can grow more, earn more and become more resilient. Funds under the eleventh replenishment support increasing income, food security and nutrition, and resilience of poor rural women and men in the poorest countries. This is realized by mainstreaming key themes such as gender, climate, nutrition and youth. IFAD also uses programming approaches that address the root causes of gender inequality and advance women’s empowerment.</description>

    <title>Support to Funding Facility for Stabilization in Iraq</title>
    <description>The project supports the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS) in Iraq, the international community’s primary mechanism for advancing stabilization and early recovery efforts in areas that have been liberated from Daesh, including devastated cities such as Mosul and Ramadi. The FFS assists the Government of Iraq in facilitating the safe return of internally displaced persons to liberated communities. This project also supports Iraq’s recovery from conflict by funding FFS initiatives that have the potential for longer-term development impact, with a focus on livelihoods projects. Project activities include: (1) providing cash-for-work opportunities to women, such as light rehabilitation work at public facilities and schools; (2) providing long-term employment opportunities for youth and women entrepreneurs, through cash grants and capacity support to small and medium-sized enterprises; (3) revitalizing the agriculture sector to support farmers and their families in rural areas and contribute to their enhanced food security; and (4) supporting the young labour force of Iraq through rehabilitation of Student Resource Centre facilities on university campuses, critical skills programs, and engagement of private sector companies/businesses in job fairs and apprenticeships.</description>

    <title>World Food Program - Multi-Country Emergency Food Assistance - CAP 2020</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations.  With the support of GAC and other donors, WFP is providing emergency food assistance to more than 90 million people facing famine, malnutrition and severe food insecurity.Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) supplementary feeding for children under five years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women; (3) emergency school feeding programs; (4) vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) food for work.</description>

    <title>Providing Food and Nutritional Assistance in Senegal - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to help vulnerable populations cope with the negative effects of COVID 19 and the restrictions put in place by the Senegalese government to fight it. This project seeks to help vulnerable households avoid resorting to negative coping strategies, minimize the risk of acute malnutrition and prevent micronutrient deficiencies from being exacerbated in pregnant and lactating women. This project also helps stabilize and improve immediate access to the nutritious foods required, so that beneficiaries can truly participate in the project initiatives.  Project activities include: (1) distributing unconditional cash transfers to targeted beneficiaries during the hunger gap and during the COVID 19 crisis; (2) providing mothers of students associations with training and capacity-building sessions to increase income-generating activities and boost their incomes; and (3) improving farmers’ access to food security by providing assistance to create community assets.  This project expects to reach 8 regions and 20 departments, as well as 806,188 beneficiaries.</description>

    <title>Support to COVID-19 Prevention, Surveillance and Containment in Mozambique</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve Mozambique’s public health sector knowledge, capacity, and surge response for forecasting/modelling, testing, diagnosis, contact tracing, and public health policy formulation to reduce mortality and morbidity from the COVID-19 pandemic. This project provides technical assistance, seconded staff and financial assistance to Mozambique’s National Health Institute to support COVID-19 prevention and containment. Project activities include: (1) modelling and forecasting disease; (2) procuring testing kits and establishing “walk-thru” testing centres in high-risk communities with COVID-19 outbreaks; (3) providing infection control/prevention by augmenting contact tracing, transporting test samples for processing and rapid diagnostics (the latter when available); and (4) providing health worker support, including training and personal protective equipment.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased effectiveness of the Government of Mozambique's response with sensitivity to vulnerable populations, including women who bear a unique burden in the face of the pandemic; and (2) improved responsiveness and gender-sensitivity of health system planning and policies adequately adapted to the Mozambican context, ensuring the Mozambique government is responsive to the evolving pandemic with the latest evidence and technology to best serve its population and high-risk groups.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2023 include: (1) Mozambique recorded 233,731 positive cases. They reported only 388 new cases since March 27, 2023, showing a significant slowdown in new infections; (2) administrated over 34 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in Mozambique, fully vaccinating 68% of the population and exceeded its target for priority groups; (3) successfully expanded testing, with all provinces offering both types of COVID-19 tests. They conducted 1,454,915 tests. They also adopted 2 new quick tests after successful evaluations; (4) established 8 walk-thru centers in busy areas, providing testing at 3 main transport hubs and 4 open-air markets. They tested 34,888 people, 55% women. These centers also helped identify 6,394 people with high-risk health conditions. The Ministry of Health found these centers effective and plans to use them for future community testing; and (5) the National Institute of Health (INS) expanded its public health labs and sentinel sites (places that monitor disease) to 7 provinces.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>India Humanitarian Response  – International Federation of the Red Cross COVID-19 Appeal</title>
    <description>April 2021 – Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in India have grown exponentially to over 17 million, with daily cases increasing from around 10,000 at the beginning of February 2021 to more than 350,000 by the end of April. According to the WHO Health Emergency Dashboard, on April 27 alone, India officially recorded over 2,700 deaths due to COVID-19. However, excess deaths attributable to the virus were likely many times this figure. This second wave has overwhelmed health infrastructure across the country. In major cities like Mumbai and Delhi, there are severe shortages of ICU hospital beds, medical oxygen and medications to treat COVID-19. Hospitals are overcrowded and turning away patients.  Hospitalization facilities, human resources capacity, bedding availability, and ambulance services are in high demand. A growing number of Indian states have implemented lockdowns.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Red Cross will support the Indian Red Cross in responding to urgent needs brought on by the most recent wave of the pandemic. Project activities include: (1) providing health supplies and equipment to affected medical facilities and communities to bolster the health system’s response; (2) expanding health service provision; and (3) implementing risk communication and hygiene promotion activities within the community.</description>

    <title>Canada’s International Marine Plastics Challenge</title>
    <description>This project reduces ocean plastics by supporting innovative solutions to plastic management in Sub-Saharan Africa. The challenge encourages solutions that prevent plastics from entering oceans by adding value to plastics and creating markets for the improved collection and management of plastic waste. The challenge also encourages solutions that support vulnerable people to manage, transform, and utilize plastics more effectively.  Project activities include: (1) supporting innovations through various stages such as ideation, pilot, testing, and scaling; (2) delivering technical assistance to attract a diverse group of innovators from local and developing contexts; (3) facilitating partnerships and collaborations between innovators; and (4) providing gender-responsive training to innovators to promote the economic, social and physical empowerment of women and girls.  This project expects to benefit those in Sub-Saharan Africa who directly interact with marine litter, especially workers informally employed in the plastics value chain. Other expected beneficiaries include innovators and applicants to the challenge, local businesses and communities. The project also anticipates benefits to broader society, as innovation could inspire a further uptake of ideas. Given the specific challenges facing women and girls in the targeted countries, the project aims to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.</description>

    <title>Emergency Drawdown Fund -– ICRC  Appeals CAP 2021</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect people’s lives and dignity affected by conflict and other violent situation. The ICRC assists and prevents further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.  With GAC’s support, the Emergency Drawdown Fund promotes early, effective, and timely humanitarian actions to respond to sudden-onset crises of significant humanitarian proportions, mainly through the provision of life-saving activities such as health care, protection services, emergency shelter, including water, sanitation and hygiene services. This new funding mechanism enables the organization to be more responsive and timely in response to sudden-onset crisis to save more lives while minimizing transaction costs.  Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise to strengthen their capacity in areas such as promoting international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and delivering relief in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of detainees and civilians not taking part in hostilities.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Global Food Crisis  - Emergency Response - ICRC 2021</title>
    <description>August 2021 - Prior to the onset of the coronavirus  (COVID-19), humanitarian needs, including those related to food security, had already reached unprecedented levels. The pandemic has exacerbated the situation by disrupting food production, supply and distribution; destabilizing food prices; and reducing country and/or consumer purchasing power. According to the July 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, in 2020 the world experienced the single largest increase in global hunger ever recorded, with as many as 160 million additional people falling deeper into hunger. This trend has only continued into 2021. In Africa in particular, hunger affects 21% of the population.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is scaling up its response to the global food crisis, including through adapting its programs to address the needs and challenges related to food insecurity in conflict settings. The ICRC is coordinating with the rest of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and National Societies, to support a local and global response to the food crisis.  With GAC’s support, the ICRC is working to ensure assistance, including food assistance, reaches the most difficult-to-access populations, in crisis- and conflict-affected contexts. Project activities include: (1) distributing nutritional supplements for the prevention of malnutrition to households with children aged six to twenty-three months; (2) providing supplementary food rations (super cereal plus) to pregnant and lactating women who visit ICRC-supported primary health care facilities; and (3) working with vulnerable farmers, livestock-keeping communities and other affected populations (including internally displaced peoples, returnees and residents) on sustainable solutions to increase their level of production.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Humanitarian Pooled Fund – OCHA 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Ukraine, an estimated 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Access to essential services is severely hindered, particularly across the “contact line” in the country’s east. The shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic added pressure on a weakened healthcare system while the provision of social services struggled. Protection remains a key concern with significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) manages Ukraine Humanitarian Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of conflict-affected populations. Project activities include: (1) providing needs-based assistance in line with priorities identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan; (2) strengthening partnerships with local and international non-governmental organizations; and (3) delivering humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas, focusing mainly on non-government-controlled areas and the contact line.</description>

    <title>Ukraine Matching Fund – Canadian Red Cross Society – 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – On February 23, 2022, Russia initiated a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine. The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, damage to power and water infrastructure, and the displacement of people largely towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that more than 2.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with more than 500,000 people fleeing to neighbouring countries and more than100,000 people internally displaced.   To respond to this crisis in a timely and effective manner, Global Affairs Canada launched the Ukraine Matching Fund in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross (CRC), with the objective of addressing the life-saving needs of people in Ukraine affected by this emergency. Through this mechanism, for every eligible donation made to the Canadian Red Cross’s Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal, between February 24 and March 18, the Government of Canada will transfer an equivalent amount to the CRC, up to a total of $30 million.  The funds will be channelled by the CRC to International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners in Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and the International Committee of the Red Cross, who will deliver immediate assistance to those most in need in the country, including populations who have been displaced. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health and protection services to affected communities in Ukraine.</description>

    <title>Horn of Africa - Food Crisis – Canadian Foodgrains Bank 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>September 2022 – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has dramatically aggravated the hunger crisis, which was already at record levels at the start of 2022; triggering disruptions of agricultural production, supply chains and trade that have raised food, fuel and fertiliser prices. Today, an unprecedented 345 million people are acutely food insecure, a 155% increase from pre-pandemic levels, with concerns that the number of food insecure people will grow. These estimates include up to 50 million people on the brink of famine and over 882,000 people facing catastrophic conditions across 4 countries: Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan.  With GAC’s support, the Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) is addressing urgent acute food insecurity amongst vulnerable populations in the Horn of Africa, including in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and South Sudan. This project focuses on meeting the immediate food and nutrition needs of people experiencing acute hunger and malnutrition.  Project activities include: (1) providing cash, vouchers, or in-kind food rations to address immediate food needs; (2) providing therapeutic and supplementary foods to boys, girls, and pregnant and lactating women; and (3) improving access to information to women and men from households experiencing acute food insecurity on sexual exploitation and abuse prevention.</description>

    <title>General Budget Support for the implementation of the PAP2A of the Plan for an Emerging Senegal</title>
    <description>This project helps the Government of Senegal to implement the Accelerated and Adjusted Priority Action Plan (PAP2A) of the Plan for an Emerging Senegal whose objectives are to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable populations, to revive socio-economic activities and to put the country back on the trajectory of emergence.  As with all budget support projects, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Senegal to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems; increase donor coordination and harmonization; and strengthen mutual accountability. This support also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) improved women entrepreneurs' access to financing and strengthened their technical and entrepreneurial skills. The interventions of the General Delegation for Rapid Entrepreneurship of Women and Youth enabled 178,555 women's entrepreneurial initiatives to access financing, for a total of $94.2 million. They also helped formalize 2,452 micro, small and medium-sized businesses and enabled 120,137 women to open 80,000 accounts to access nano-credit in the amount of $59.2 million, or 87% of the financing granted; (2) strengthened the skills of 111,493 workers in businesses and professional organizations and assisted 61,218 women with Vocational and technical training finance fund; (3) installed 4,729 pieces of equipment to lighten household chores, giving 786,000 women more time to engage in income-generating activities and increasing their financial autonomy; (4) implemented reforms and programs to eliminate gender-based violence and promote human rights. This included holding various legal consultation, legal assistance, advisory and mediation activities for 6,078 litigants (women and men). These reforms and programs also involved setting up a telephone platform ("Wallu Allo 116") to listen and provide referrals to women and children who are victims of violence, and creating 333 girls' clubs to prevent early pregnancy, gender-based violence and child marriage. Lastly, they focused on providing advice and services to 132,215 adolescents and women. (5) cereal crop yields and peanut production increased by 25% and 18%, respectively, compared with the most recent 5-year average. (6) a gender report on the distribution of agricultural inputs was produced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Infrastructure and noted that, while women represented 21.6% of recipients of agricultural inputs, women only received 12.5% of the quantity and 17.5% of the value of the subsidized inputs; (7) a positive discrimination measure for women was adopted and applied, giving women farmers a 10% rebate on livestock mortality insurance premiums and a 5% rebate on crop loss insurance premiums; and (8) implemented measures to enhance the state's performance in responsible and transparent public financial management, notably by improving the administrative control and internal audit system.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Multi-country - Emergency Health Assistance - Doctors Without Borders 2021-2023</title>
    <description>January 2021 - In 2021, approximately 235 million people across the world will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection due in part to ongoing conflicts, natural disasters and recent disease outbreaks. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated the needs globally and placed further strain on an already stretched humanitarian system. In response to the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs, GAC’s humanitarian assistance is providing predictable, multi-year, multi-country support to longstanding partners to deliver quality programming in protracted humanitarian contexts globally.  With GAC’s support, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 450,000 beneficiaries per year in each country of operation. This project focuses on providing access to primary and secondary healthcare, including the provision of sexual and reproductive health services in countries where we are operating, specifically in countries affected by conflict, situations of violence and other emergencies.  Project activities include: (1) providing at least 2,000,000 outpatient consultations to populations in the area of response; (2) setting up, operating and providing at lest 335,000 patient treatments in MSF managed centres in areas of a confirmed disease outbreak; (3) providing targeted vaccination campaigns and disease case management in areas of response; (4) providing malnutrition MUAC screening and therapeutic feeding care to children under the age of five; and (5) distributing non-food item kits including bed nets, and sanitation supplies (targeting pregnant and lactating women, and children under the age of five).</description>

    <title>COVID-19 Multi Country Emergency Response - World Food Programme 2020</title>
    <description>November 2020 – The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a multiplier of vulnerability, compounding threats to food insecurity and exacerbating the ability of affected communities to cope. The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by getting food to the hungry quickly, and works to help prevent hunger in the future. In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. In the context of COVID-19, WFP is addressing the significant rise in immediate food insecurity caused by the pandemic in countries where unmet food-assistance needs are the most pronounced, and where there has been the greatest deterioration in the food security situation.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) supplementary feeding for children under the age of five, as well as pregnant and lactating women; (3) emergency school feeding programs; (4) vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) food for work.</description>

    <title>COVID-19 Emergency Response - Doctors Without Borders 2021</title>
    <description>February 2021 - The rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems, disrupted economies and altered livelihoods in many parts of the world. People living in crisis-affected settings, often in over-crowded areas, are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides medical humanitarian operations to vulnerable populations at risk of contracting and spreading the virus in countries affected by war, armed conflict and other situations of violence.  With GAC’s support, MSF aims to minimize the consequences of the pandemic on affected populations through activities that include: (1) providing direct patient care to those affected by COVID-19; (2) increasing access to primary and secondary medical care in places where gaps exist in local health systems as a result of COVID-19; and (3) increasing awareness in affected communities about the virus and prevention measures.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Afghanistan Crisis  - Emergency Response - ICRC 2022</title>
    <description>December 2021 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs have worsened, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2022, 24 million people are projected to require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the ICRC’s humanitarian operations aim to provide protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to vulnerable Afghans and promote respect for international humanitarian law.  Project activities include: (1) providing and improving health services; (2) distributing hygiene kits and providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable people; (3) improving water and sanitation services; (4) increasing the protection of people affected by violence; and (5) promoting respect for humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law.</description>

    <title>Ukraine Matching Fund – Canadian Red Cross Society – 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 – On February 23, 2022, Russia initiated a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine. The onset of hostilities has caused civilian casualties, damage to power and water infrastructure, and the displacement of people largely towards the west of Ukraine and into bordering countries. It is estimated that more than 2.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with more than 500,000 people fleeing to neighbouring countries and more than100,000 people internally displaced.   To respond to this crisis in a timely and effective manner, Global Affairs Canada launched the Ukraine Matching Fund in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross (CRC), with the objective of addressing the life-saving needs of people in Ukraine affected by this emergency. Through this mechanism, for every eligible donation made to the Canadian Red Cross’s Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal, between February 24 and March 18, the Government of Canada will transfer an equivalent amount to the CRC, up to a total of $30 million.  The funds will be channelled by the CRC to International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners in Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and the International Committee of the Red Cross, who will deliver immediate assistance to those most in need in the country, including populations who have been displaced. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; and (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health and protection services to affected communities in Ukraine.</description>

    <title>Türkiye/Syria Matching Fund – Canadian Red Cross Society – 2022</title>
    <description>March 2023 – Since early February 2023, Türkiye and Syria have been impacted by multiple severe earthquakes that have resulted in over 40,000 deaths and significant damage to infrastructure. Overall, it is estimated that 9.1 million people in Türkiye and 8.8 million in Syria have been directly affected by the earthquakes. Needs assessments have revealed vulnerable earthquake-affected populations require urgent access to shelter and food assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene services, and healthcare.  To respond to this crisis in a timely and effective manner, Global Affairs Canada is matching $10 million of donations made to the Canadian Red Cross’ (CRC) Earthquake in Türkiye and Syria Appeal. The Matching Fund is addressing the life-saving needs of people affected by the earthquakes, with funds being channeled by the CRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its partners to undertake earthquake response activities. Project activities include: (1) addressing food security and nutrition needs; (2) distributing shelter and hygiene materials and other non-food items; and (3) providing health and protection services to earthquake-affected communities.</description>

    <title>Support to UNICEF COVID-19 Response Plan in Mali</title>
    <description>This Project supports UNICEF’s multi-sectoral response plan to COVID-19 in Mali, which seeks to to limit COVID-19 related mortality and consequences on protection, health and education for the most vulnerable children. Project activities include: (1) developing gender responsive and age sensitive hygiene and infection prevention campaigns; (2) ensuring the availability of WASH services and products in healthcare facilities and schools and for vulnerable populations, such as internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities, (3) providing infection prevention and control materials and training to health care workers; (4) providing adequate protection services to girls and boys at risk, to prevent and respond to sexual abuse, family separation, gender based violence (GBV), and stigmatization; and (5) providing school aged children and their caregivers access to distance learning opportunities; and vi) supporting the schools in their preparedness to reopening and reintegrating vulnerable children in a safe learning environment.  With Canada’s assistance, the Project aims to reach 5,000,000 people (50% women and girls) nationwide with adequate information on hygiene and other prevention measures through gender-responsive communication, community engagement, and social mobilization. Approximately 400,000 children aged 0 to 19 (50% girls) from six regions – Bamako, Mopti, Koulikouro, Timbuktu, Gao and Kayes - will benefit from targeted interventions in WASH, health, child protection and education.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Local Agricultural Supply Chains - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project contributes to protecting the food security and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations impacted by COVID-19 in nine countries, focusing on women, youth, and indigenous peoples. This project works with local governments and civil society groups to ensure communities most impacted by COVID-19 have sustained access to nutritious food and income sources. This project also addresses trade barriers in the food and agricultural sector, improves food safety standards during COVID-19 and beyond, and strengthens local capacity for data collection and analysis to make informed policy decisions that enhance local food systems. This project focuses on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts women and men differently and activities are adapted to help ensure women and men’s equal participation. Project activities include: (1) conducting rapid assessments of community and household-level needs, including local market capacities and gaps related to COVID-19; (2) supporting women and men who farm with facilitated access to seeds and other farm inputs, markets, training in climate-smart agricultural practices, and income diversification activities; (3) strengthening rural and agricultural community-based organizations, including women’s organizations, through training focused on addressing barriers related to COVID-19 in coordination with local government services and departments; and (4) providing support for gender-responsive public social protection programs that reach rural and marginalized communities.</description>

    <title>World Food Programme – COVID-19 - 2020</title>
    <description>March 2020 – In response to the COVID19 global pandemic, the United Nations launched the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) on 25 March 2020. The GHRP seeks to respond to the direct public health and immediate humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. It has three strategic priorities: 1) containing the spread of the pandemic; 2) decreasing the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion and livelihoods; and 3) protecting, assisting and advocating for refugees, internally displaced people, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the pandemic.  With GAC’s support, WFP is providing tangible assets and supply chain services required for humanitarian and health actors to be able to deliver the response outlined in this GHRP. Project activities include: (1) establishing and reinforcing international staging areas and regional hubs for cargo consolidation and forwarding; (2) providing logistics services through sea vessels and aircrafts, from international staging areas to regional hubs, and onwards to priority country points of entry; and (3) providing the humanitarian community with medical evacuation services and the infrastructure for field clinics (not medical equipment) for front line aid workers.</description>

    <title>West and Central Africa Emergency Food Assistance - World Food Programme</title>
    <description>January 2021 - The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and helps prevent hunger in the future. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations. This project operates in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria.  With GAC’s support, in humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and protect livelihoods. Project activities include: (1) distributing food; and (2) providing supplementary feeding for children under the age of 5 years, as well as pregnant and lactating women.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Afghanistan Crisis  - Wheat Procurement - WFP 2022</title>
    <description>November 2022 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs have worsened, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2022, an estimated 24 million people require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  With GAC’s support in humanitarian emergencies, the World Food Program (WFP) focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity and protect livelihoods. Project activities include (1) procuring and milling wheat from Ukraine; and (2) transporting and distributing wheat in Afghanistan.</description>

    <title>United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women - 03</title>
    <description>This project represents additional emergency support of $10 million to the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women (UNTF). Canada's emergency funding is allocated to the UNTF's COVID-19 Special Funding Window. Project activities include: (1) supporting the core capacity of the UNTF's existing grantees, which are primarily women’s rights organizations, to ensure the stability of projects focused on gender-based violence and the long term sustainability of the organizations; (2) supporting the COVID-19 Response Special Funding Window, which facilitates a targeted call for proposals to fund projects designed to support women and girls survivors of gender-based violence related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) supporting a platform for identifying, analyzing and disseminating useful lessons from the results of UNTF COVID-19 response and the creation of partnerships and leveraging of resources and commitments to end violence against women and girls in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating gender-based violence, especially against women and girls. Multiple forms of violence are occurring during the pandemic and the most commonly reported is intimate partner violence. This violence is fueled by financial insecurity in households related to quarantine measures. In many cities and communities around the world, emergency services and institutional responses are overwhelmed by the COVID-19 health crisis. These and other service providers have rapidly lost the capacity to respond to the needs of women and girl survivors of violence. Civil society and women's organizations are playing a critical role at the community level and their sustained operations are vital to a comprehensive and successful pandemic response.</description>

    <title>World Food Program - Multi-Country Emergency Food Assistance - CAP 2020</title>
    <description>The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations’ frontline agency in the fight against hunger. It responds to emergencies, saves lives by quickly getting food to the hungry, and works to help prevent hunger in the future.  In humanitarian emergencies, WFP focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and to protect livelihoods. As the global lead agency for logistics and emergency telecommunications, WFP also plays a major role in providing common services for the humanitarian community. It transports passengers undertaking humanitarian work, carries light cargo for humanitarian agencies, and carries out emergency medical and security evacuations.  Project activities include: (1) distributing food; (2) supplementary feeding for children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women; (3) providing emergency school feeding programs; (4) providing vouchers and cash transfers for food; and (5) providing food for work. With the support of GAC and other donors, WFP provides emergency food assistance to more than 90 million people facing famine, malnutrition and severe food insecurity.</description>

    <title>UNICEF Emergency Afghanistan Support 2022</title>
    <description>December 2021 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs have worsened, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2022, an estimated 24 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  With Global Affairs Canada’s support, in humanitarian emergencies, UNICEF is providing life-saving health and nutrition interventions for children, pregnant and lactating women to support the treatment, growth and development of healthy children. The main activity for this project is to procure ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severe acute malnutrition and child wasting.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to the Afghanistan Crisis  - Emergency Response - WFP 2022</title>
    <description>December 2021 - Before the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. Since the Taliban takeover, humanitarian needs have worsened, and the challenging operational context has been further complicated. In 2022, an estimated 24 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and climatic events.  With GAC’s support in humanitarian emergencies, World Food Program (WFP) focuses on providing targeted food assistance to reduce acute malnutrition and food insecurity, and protect livelihoods. Project activities include: (1) distributing food; and (2) providing supplementary feeding for children under the age of 5 years, as well as for pregnant and lactating women.</description>

    <title>Coronavirus - Emergency Response - World Health Organization 2020</title>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts. In early 2020, the WHO and Chinese authorities identified a new coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in the People’s Republic of China. The WHO and its partners are working with Chinese authorities and global experts to identify populations most at risk, the transmission of the disease, and the most effective ways to detect, interrupt, and contain human to human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak in the China, a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”, indicating that the outbreak requires a more robust coordinated international response. The WHO released its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (February to April 2020) outlining its strategy to scale-up the response in order to stop further spread of the disease.  With GAC’s support, WHO’s emergency operations work to help and control the spread of the coronavirus and support the international response to the outbreak. Project activities include: (1) deploying experts to assess outbreak threat; (2) delivering essential medicines, supplies and equipment; (3) training health personnel; and (4) strengthening health sector coordination and health information systems.</description>

    <title>COVID-19 response mechanism</title>
    <description>This project aims to support countries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on programs fighting Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis and malaria. The project also supports countries to recover from COVID-19 by strengthening health systems and future pandemic preparedness and response. Project activities include: (1) procuring and delivering approximately 6,329,000 antigen rapid diagnostic tests to low-income and lower middle-income countries. The most severely-affected countries in Africa expect to benefit from 75% of the supplies and 25% to the hardest-hit countries in Asia; (2) supporting new approaches to continue access to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria services during the pandemic. This includes virtual health service delivery, door-to-door delivery of mosquito nets, and dual COVID-19 and tuberculosis screening programs; and (3) supporting gender-based violence prevention and post-violence care programs due to the increased gender and intimate partner violence during COVID-19 lockdowns.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased support for measures taken by countries to fight the pandemic; (2) mitigated the impact of COVID-19 on the fight against HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria; and (3) improved health and community systems.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of April 2023 include: (1) supported a steady and reliable supply and delivery of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment materials through the COVID-19 Response Mechanism (C19RM). This allowed countries to acquire urgently needed commodities before the Omicron variant’s peak in 2022. This includes delivery of 66.3 million Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Tests and 15.5 million Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests to targeted countries; (2) contributed to bring down the price of Antigen Rapid Diagnostics Tests from over US$5 per unit to US$1. This made diagnostics more affordable to low and middle-income countries; (3) supported C19RM tuberculosis programs rebounded strongly in 2022. This allowed the majority of countries to reach pre-COVID levels of tuberculosis case reporting by the end of 2022; and (4) supported countries to adopt innovative interventions to maintain and improve health service provision through the C19RM. For example, the C19RM supported countries to roll-out bidirectional testing, enabling patients to be screened and tested for tuberculosis and COVID-19 simultaneously. This stopped the onward transmission of both diseases and ensured the diagnosis, treatment, and cure of people with both diseases.</resultsAchieved>
