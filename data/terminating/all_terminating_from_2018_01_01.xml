    <title>Empowering the Palestinian Security Sector</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the operation of the Palestinian security sector, through support to the Office of the Quartet (OQ), in a manner that improves the lives of Palestinians and helps ensure stability in the West Bank and Gaza. Project activities include: (1) helping the Palestinian Authority increase safety and security in Palestinian communities where security services have not previously been available; (2) strengthening the functioning of the Customs Police; and (3) monitoring and assessing relevant policies, actions or activities that relate to the security and justice sectors. The project is also assessing the ability of the Palestinian judicial police to serve warrants and execute judgments of the family courts, which impact women and children in particular.</description>

    <title>Women of Courage - Women, Peace and Security</title>
    <description>This project aims to empower women human rights defenders and organizations to effectively participate in peacebuilding, reconciliation, and human rights processes in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and the West Bank. The project seeks to strengthen beneficiaries’ ability to use national laws and international human rights frameworks to defend and protect women’s rights in conflict settings. Project activities include: (1) providing psychosocial and legal support to help women survivors recover from and seek justice for the physical and psychological violence they have experienced; (2)  training  women human rights defenders and organizations and other key stakeholders on national and international human rights frameworks, gender-based analysis, and organizational strengthening; (3) developing or improving  National Action Plans and implementing  the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) on women, peace and security; and (4) establishing South-South exchanges to facilitate networking, mutual learning and skills building.  This project expects to reach about 35,000 beneficiaries (78% women and 22% men) directly in the five countries or territories, including approximately 9,500 women survivors of gender-based violence.  It also expects to indirectly reach 200,000 (150,000 women and 50,000 men) beneficiaries nationally, including extended families, community members, networks, government employees, other stakeholders, and another two million indirect beneficiaries internationally through networks, coalitions, and social media.</description>

    <title>Combatting Gender-Based Violence in Bangladesh</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen Bangladesh’s capacity to both reduce actual violence against women and girls and the widespread acceptance of violence against women in Bangladesh.  It provides women with tools to improve their own safety, in public, at home, and at work and at the same time it works with public and private institutions to implement policies to prevent violence against women.  The project collaborates with families and communities to create more gender equitable roles and relations inside households.  It also supports and reinforces Bangladesh’s own policies and regulations concerning violence against women and generates knowledge and capacity that contribute to more effective prevention of gender-based violence by government and civil society.</description>

    <title>Creating Opportunities and Preventing Migration of Unaccompanied Girls, Boys and Adolescents</title>
    <description>The project aims to prevent children and youth from undertaking unaccompanied migration from two communities in Honduras where poverty and widespread violence prevail. The project is designed to help protect vulnerable young adolescents (between the age of 10 and 14) from violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, and to increase economic opportunities for older adolescents (between the age of 15 and 19) who are at-risk of migrating, with a particular focus on girls.  Project activities include: (1) creating local clubs for adolescents where social, emotional competencies and self-protection training and awareness activities are offered; (2) providing training for schools, communities and families on gender equality, including positive and equitable relationships; (3) providing market-oriented vocational and entrepreneurship training and developing transferrable life skills for older adolescents, including self-control, self-esteem, motivation and job-seeking skills; (4) sharing the project’s successes and lessons learned with governments and civil society to contribute to the design of gender-sensitive policies and programs that prevent the unaccompanied migration of girls, boys and adolescents.  The project is part of a regional initiative implemented in the Northern Triangle countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala), co-funded by the governments of Mexico and Germany</description>

    <title>Evidence for Empowerment</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen the capacity of the National Institute for Statistics in Mozambique to improve the availability of reliable and comprehensive sex-disaggregated population data.  The goal is to produce gender-sensitive analysis for evidence-based decision making and policy formulation, with a focus on sexual reproductive health and rights, HIV and gender equality. This initiative contributes to the empowerment of women and girls by closing the gap in gender data.  Project activities include: (1) providing technical assistance and results reporting expertise in the delivery and analysis of the census; (2) commission at least 8 thematic studies upon completion of the census, including  gender analysis and recommendations to advance gender equality; (3) develop a post census strategy to create increased demand from decision-makers for data informed research including campaigns designed to promote thematic studies in the public and policy domains, enhancing their policy impact.</description>

    <title>Women’s Voices and Leadership - Haiti</title>
    <description>This project aims to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls by supporting local organizations that advance women’s rights in Haiti. It is building the capacity of local women’s rights organizations to provide services to their constituents; help women to know and claim their rights; advocate for gender equality; and empower women and girls. The project reflects growing international evidence of the critical role that local women’s rights and feminist organizations play in advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Project activities include the provision of: (1) multi-year funding to selected local women’s rights organizations; (2) targeted capacity building to organizations selected for multi-year funding; (3) support to strengthen networks and alliances between women’s rights organizations; and (4) small, short-term funding to local women’s rights organizations and networks to pilot innovative ideas and approaches, and to respond quickly to unforeseen events and opportunities. This project aims to enable women's organizations in Haiti to improve the management of their programs, increase the quality of services offered and work to restore strong support networks that is expected to directly benefit more than 3,000 women and girls, and indirectly to more than 130,000 women and girls.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved management, programming and sustainability of local women’s rights organizations in Haiti, particularly those representing vulnerable and marginalized women and girls; (2) enhanced delivery of services and advocacy by women’s rights organizations to advance gender equality in Haiti; and (3) increased effectiveness of national and sub-national women’s rights platforms, networks and alliances to affect gender-sensitive policy change and policy implementation in Haiti.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project in December 2023 include: (1) built capacity for 31 local women's civil society organisations and 6 women's networks. This helped to improve their ability to provide support to more than 4,232 survivors of gender-based violence (GBV); (2) delivered training, workshops and advocacy activities to advance women's rights and combat GBV for more than 50,237 people (including 44,139 women); (3) provided financial support  of $1.89 million to 78 women's and feminist civil society organisations (F/CSOs) through responsive funding for specific activities aimed at defending women's interests and improving their conditions. This includes the purchase of equipment for mobile canteens to fund their advocacy activities; (4) provided support to an organisation in the North-East to adopt a departmental action plan for gender-sensitive judicial protection to help prevent rape in prisons or during arrests; (5) developed a strengthening plan for 30 CSOs/F to help them with their advocacy and funding efforts; (6) provided technical support to 21 partner organisations to help them increase their income-generating activities (observed average increase of 50%) so that they can continue their work after the end of the project; and (7) launched an online platform against GBV where a number of tools and resources remain available for civil society organisations and the Haitian population.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Reducing Barriers for Uniformed Women in UN Peace Operations</title>
    <description>This project aims to support decision-makers in UN Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) with evidence and knowledge of the barriers limiting the deployment of uniformed women to United Nations (UN) Peace Operations. The participation and full involvement of women is important for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and yet, the proportion of uniformed women deploying on UN Peace Operations is very low. With a better understanding of why there are so few uniformed women, effective measures can be taken to reduce these gender imbalances. Project activities include: (1) collaborating with national or regional research partners from 8 selected TPCCs; (2) developing a comprehensive Barrier Assessment Methodology to undertake research of the barriers to women’s participation in UN Peace Operations resulting in detailed reports and policy recommendations to TPCCs; and (3) producing a series of Policy Briefs to inform policy development on women’s participation in UN Peace Operations at both country and multilateral levels.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project are improved policies and practices of Troop and Police Contributing Countries to reduce barriers to uniformed women’s deployment to UN Peace Operations.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2022 include: (1) developed and published a groundbreaking Measuring Opportunities for Women in Peace Operations (MOWIP) barrier assessment methodology in October 2020. This provided Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) necessary tools to identify and assess barriers and opportunities for uniformed women’s meaningful participation in peace operations within their institutions; (2) collaborated with seven national and regional research partners from the selected TPCCs to develop country-specific comprehensive Barrier Assessment Methodology. This resultd in detailed reports and policy recommendations to TPCCs. The Ghana Armed Forces, the National Police and National Gendarmerie of Senegal, the Armed Forces of Uruguay, the National Police of Uruguay and the Zambia Police Service completed their MOWIP Barrier Assessments Reports. These Barrier Assessments increased the knowledge of decision-makers on current obstacles to the meaningful participation of uniformed women in peace operations to enable innovative and transformative policies to address these challenges; and (3) produced and published six policy briefs as part of the Opportunities for Women in Peacekeeping: Policy Series, launched on February 9, 2022. This included the guest entry From More to Meaningful: Six strategies to make women’s participation count in peace support operations in the London School of Economics and Political Science Women, Peace and Security blog. The  policy briefs aimed to promote a shift in policy frameworks and their corresponding policy actions from increasing participation in numbers to increasing meaningful participation by transforming structures, practices and attitudes.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Women's Voice and Leadership - Senegal</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organisations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting their activities, building their institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the significant, globally recognized gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world.  This project is implemented by the Centre d’étude et de coopération internationale (CECI). It directly supports 20 women rights organizations at the local level, and 5 organizations networks representing more than 20 organizations each. In addition, this project allows women organizations to adopt innovative management practices that contribute to their program’s sustainability and to ensure better quality of their services and, through innovative approaches, to conduct networking, advocacy and social monitoring activities that indirectly benefit more than 100 000 people in the country.</description>

    <title>Environmental Rehabilitation and Improving Livelihoods in Cox's Bazar</title>
    <description>The project aims to secure a safe and healthy environment for the affected host community population in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. It aims to do so by: (1) addressing their urgent cooking fuel needs; (2) improving their economic livelihoods and food security; and (3) rehabilitating the natural resource base while preventing further environmental degradation in the region. Being one of the world’s largest refugee camps, Cox’s Bazar has hosted an unprecedented number of Rohingya since August 2017. This is putting immense pressure on scarce natural resources in the area, resulting in degraded natural forests, barren hills and an emerging water crisis. This situation calls for responses in order to help restore the environment and ecosystem, as well as measures to prevent further degradation and to support early restoration. The project objectives include supplying alternative clean cooking fuel and technology to women-headed households; providing livelihood and income generation support, particularly to vulnerable women and girls; and fostering environmental practices to reduce pollution and encourage sustainable natural resource management. Project activities include:  (1) distributing liquid petroleum gas (LPG) stove kits, including burners, hoses, regulator and gas cylinders; providing monthly refills of LPG; training on safe usage, best practices in cooking methods and fire safety; raising awareness on community fire safety and prevention through distributing outreach material (for example, radio communication, leaflets, posters); and providing fire service and civil defence training on safe usage and management of the LPG cook-stoves; (2) providing training and start-up support for fostering livelihoods and income-generation; establishing gender-inclusive, climate-sensitive farmer field schools for improving food production and post-harvest storage of high demand and high nutrition crops; promoting the adoption of climate-sensitive farming and fishing technologies and practices; and (3) implementing cash-for-work programs for land stabilization through erosion control, reforestation and maintenance work; establishing agro-forestry and collaborative forest management systems; and implementing cash-for work programs for planting of fast-growing wood fuel plants/tree nurseries and seedling production.  This project is a component of the US$118 million multi-donor “UN-Joint-Project To Address Cooking Fuel Needs, Environmental Degradation and Food Security for Populations Affected By The Refugee Crisis”  implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agricultural Organization(FAO) and administered by the UNDP.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased provision of alternative, clean cooking fuel and technology to host community households, particularly those headed by women; (2) increased empowerment and livelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable, especially women and girls, in host communities; and (3) enhanced natural resource base and reduced environmental impact of the refugee influx.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (June 2022) include: (1) distributed 1,056,299 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders, including refills to 29,629 host community and 96,641 Rohingya households as alternative cooking fuel to help reduce community reliance on firewood, thus protecting surrounding forest resources; (2) 98% of targeted households reported increased use of LPG; (3) according to the mid-term evaluation, 97% of host community beneficiaries reported reduction in firewood expenditure; (4) stabilized and restored 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) of degraded plantation areas and forestland representing 100% of the program target; (5) stabilized 292 hectares (721 acres) of vulnerable landscape in Rohingya refugee camps through tree planting, which has helped reduce disaster risks and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of forest and land degradation; (6) 10,417 vulnerable women received vocational and life-skills training, along with a monthly allowance of Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 1,050 (about Can$14.00) to enable them to complete learning; (7) 413 women and 87 men received training and technical support under the climate adaptive agriculture component, including in areas such as innovative agricultural techniques for the production of saline-resistant crops and entrepreneurial skills. Upon completion of training and submission of their business plans, the participants received a cash grant/business capital of BDT 15,000 (about Can$203) each, enabling them to start their businesses; (8) 22,504 (21,114 women; 1,390 men) entrepreneurs, farmers and smallholders received financial and business development assistance, including training in livelihood activities and effective use of start-up support; (9) supported 1,440 (506 women; 934 men) agriculturalists in adopting climate-sensitive agricultural practices and high-demand and high-nutrient and high-value crop production, marketing, and management. They also received training on community-supported agriculture, post-harvest processing and value addition; (10) enabled 2,880 (1,012 women; 1,868 me)] agriculturalists to benefit from climate-sensitive agricultural practices, production of high-demand nutrient crops, marketing, and management; (11) 7,000 Rohingya refugees received skills-building training in a variety of areas, including kitchen gardening, tailoring, basket weaving, and upcycling; (12) 6,352 beneficiaries received technical and vocational training in high-demand skills areas, including computing, plumbing, and machine repair. The majority of the trainees secured meaningful employment upon graduation; (13) Provided training to 22,249 (21,070 women; 1,179 men]) in livelihood activities and business start-up support; (14) 1,440 (506 women; 934 men) farmers received hybrid vegetable seeds. Among these, 720 received agro-mechanization support services to improve production; and (15) a medium-term impact of the above support led to increased average household income from BDT 5,051 (Can$71.00), in early 2021, to between BDT 6,896 (Can$97.00) and BDT13,860 (Can$195) by mid-2021 among targeted beneficiaries.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Health and  Education in Cox's Bazar</title>
    <description>The influx of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Myanmar into Bangladesh since August 2017 has increased the total displaced Rohingya population to approximately 1 million people in the Cox’s Bazar District of Bangladesh. This population, including large numbers of women, children and other vulnerable groups, has significant needs for health, nutrition and population and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, and is placing an immense strain on an already under-resourced service delivery system. There is also a significant need for education and life skills learning support for the approximately 300,000 Rohingya children and adolescents, as well as needs for teacher training, psycho-social activities to deal with shock and trauma and awareness raising among Rohingya children, adolescents and their families on issues such as child rights, gender violence and personal safety. The sudden influx of Rohingya has also posed an unprecedented burden on the host communities (approximately 1.3 million people) which were already among the poorest in Bangladesh.  This project supports the Government of Bangladesh’s efforts to address the health, nutrition and basic education needs of the displaced Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar. Through an innovative financing mechanism, for every dollar contributed by Canada, the World Bank is providing five additional grant dollars in support of health and basic education services for the Rohingya. The project has two components: (1) a health component, which enables the displaced Rohingya, particularly women and girls, to access maternal, neonatal, infant, child and adolescent health and nutrition services, as well as reproductive health care and family planning support; and (2) a basic education component, which provides Rohingya children and adolescents access to basic education in a safe environment; and psycho-social services aimed at helping Rohingya children recover from shocks and prevent exploitation, with a focus on girls who are often victims of gender-based violence.  By enhancing the Government of Bangladesh’s service delivery systems in Cox’s Bazar, the project also benefits the affected host communities.</description>

    <title>Women’s Voice and Leadership - Pakistan</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organisations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting activities, building institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the globally recognized, significant gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world. The project seeks to advance gender equality in Pakistan by: (1) supporting the work of, and strengthening women’s rights organizations (WROs); (2) supporting capacity building in proposal development, leadership skills, media, legal frameworks pertaining to women, and on feminist monitoring, evaluation and learning; (3) providing organizational development training to select WROs based on needs identified by them; (4) providing direct grants for operational support and to facilitate the implementation and monitoring of WROs’ programs; and (5) providing responsive funding, research grants and funding for developing one national level alliance.</description>

    <title>Women of Ukraine: Heard, Capable and Resilient</title>
    <description>The project aims to increase the fulfilment of human rights for women and girls, advancing gender equality in Ukraine. The project seeks to build the capacity of 65 women’s rights organizations (WROs) and supports 40 advocacy campaigns through delivering small grants. The project promotes the inclusion of the women’s movement into a broader reform agenda and national development processes by engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, including non-government organizations, local authorities, key decision-makers, media, trade unions and religious organizations. In response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, they adapted certain project activities to address new immediate needs and protect previous development gains. The implementing partner pivoted project activities to respond to the evolving context in several ways, such as providing emergency supplies, equipment and services, mental health support, transportation and accommodation.  Project activities include: (1) establishing and strengthening organizational and technical potential capacities  of five women’s rights organizations to become inter-regional centers of excellence (hubs); (2) empowering five hubs to cascade down capacity development support to local women’s rights organizations; (3) providing support to 73 local women’s rights organizations  within the ‘Superpower for Women’s rights organizations’ program launched by the project; (4) increasing access to funding for the local WROs through various funding mechanisms supporting advocacy campaigns, gender-sensitive research, promotion of gender equality and women’s economic empowerment; and creating issue-based coalitions for supporting human rights.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved management and sustainability of local women’s rights organizations in Ukraine; (2) enhanced performance of women’s rights organizations programming and advocacy to advance gender equality in Ukraine; and (3) increased effectiveness of national, regional, and local women’s platforms, networks and alliances effecting gender-sensitive policy change and policy implementation in Ukraine.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2023 include: (1) 5 project hubs and over 30 % of local women’s rights organizations (WROs) beneficiaries demonstrated high involvement in developing important state policies, including the State Strategy for Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and Men for 2021-2030 and the National Action Plan for the Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325; (2) 5 project hubs managed to mobilize 14 local WROs to provide humanitarian support  to 11,648 women and children most affected by the war during the first three months after Russia’s invasion. This included distribution of food, medicine, and hygiene supplies, and furnishing and equipping shelters for temporary housing and provision of psychological support services; (3) conducted over 400 mentoring activities for local WROs, including 98 group and 319 individual mentoring sessions during year 4. 61 local WROs received individual and group consultations, and 12 more WROs received other types of mentoring support, namely short-term training, webinars, and support on coordination. The project applied a balanced approach by implementing capacity development activities, resource mobilization and volunteering initiatives, advocacy for women's participation in decision-making and provision of psych-emotional support; (4)  awarded 21 grants in year 4, allowing 21 unique organizations (including Hubs and local WROs) to focus on the most pressing needs of their constituencies, including advocacy support for internally displaced women and women living in de-occupied territories, policy dialogue with host communities to enhance integration of displaced people, promotion of economic opportunities and increased access to services. Some of the completed grants have resulted in the adoption of important policy documents and economic programs by local communities and the establishment of facilities for almost 1200 beneficiaries, including 75 rural women, 11 women with disabilities, internally displaced women, young women, and girls (17), 227 mothers of three and more children, 8 senior women, 30 women released from prison, 12 Roma women and other groups affected by the war and living in difficult life circumstances; and (5) completed the development of the Strategic Information Portal on Gender Equality, updated with the latest available statistics, and presented it to the public. As of March 31, 2023, more than 1.1K visitors viewed data on the portal.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Gender-Responsive Education and Transformation</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve equal learning outcomes for girls and boys at the primary school level in Ghana, Mozambique and Rwanda. Project activities include: (1) integrating gender-responsive play-based learning into teaching practices; (2) engaging parents and caregivers in addressing the gender-specific learning needs of girls and boys, including at-risk children; and (3) increasing the integration of gender-responsive play-based learning techniques in teacher training (pre-service and in-service). Project beneficiaries include 221,486 children (of which 109,057 are girls), 23,228 teachers (of which 1,682 are women), and 744,974 community members, including mothers, fathers and caregivers in all three countries. The project also supports “Play Your Part”, an initiative that aims to reach more than 50,000 students aged 8-14 years, in 200 schools across Canada every year. The project builds on the achievements and lessons learned from Right To Play’s project “Play for Advancement of Quality Education” (project number D000893001), an eight country, two-and-a-half-year (2015-2017) initiative.</description>

    <title>Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol - Institutional Support 2018-2020</title>
    <description>This contribution represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MFMP). The Multilateral Fund uses these funds, along with other donors’ funding, to achieve its mandate.  The Multilateral Fund provides support to developing countries to help phase out the use and production of substances that break down the earth's protective ozone layer. The destruction of the ozone layer allows increased ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth. This is detrimental to human health and diminishes the productivity of important food crops. The Multilateral Fund promotes technological change in developing countries by helping to increase the use of environmentally safe products and equipment through technical assistance, the conversion of industrial facilities, and strengthening key organizations.  The Multilateral Fund secretariat is based in Montreal.</description>

    <title>Work Empowerment for Women in Iraq</title>
    <description>The project aims to increase protection and access to equitable employment for women in Iraq. Through collaboration with the Iraqi Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Justice’s Higher Judicial Council, Iraqi law firms, the Iraqi Bar Association, Iraqi trade unions, and local women’s community organizations, the project informs women of their rights in the workplace, gives them resources to ensure they are respected, and thereby encourages them to join the workforce.  Project activities include: (1) the training of up to 275 women, following which at least 85% will be able to demonstrate knowledge of their rights in the workplace and how to assert them; (2) the establishment of a monitoring and liaison body on gender discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Up to 75 labour court judges and lawyers and up to 120 labour inspectors will be trained for this purpose; and (3) Addressing the social and cultural stigmas inhibiting women’s access to work, and providing them with informed narratives that promote the role of Iraqi women in the country’s economic revitalization.  As a result of this implementation, Iraqi women will be able to enter and remain in the workforce without fear of discrimination or harassment, allowing them to contribute toward Iraq’s economic revitalization.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Community Cohesion in Cox’s Bazar</title>
    <description>The project aims to build the economic resilience and social cohesion for persons living in the host communities affected by the influx of displaced Rohingya people into Cox’s Bazar. Cox’s Bazar is one of Bangladesh’s poorest and most vulnerable districts, with poverty well above the country’s national average. The influx of over 740,000 Rohingya since August 2017 has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources, including for jobs and income, among the Rohingya and the host communities, as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation poses a threat to peace and stability in the area, raising concerns about potential inter-communal or extremist violence which could have catastrophic implications, especially for women and children who are the most vulnerable.  The project aims to reduce the drivers of conflict and violence in Cox’s Bazar by providing skills training, employment support for women and young men in the host communities, and quick-impact community development projects to rehabilitate infrastructure and improve the safety and security of women and girls. To strengthen community cohesion, the project builds local capacity to address and defuse conflicts, including empowering women as community mediators and champions of peace.  Project activities are: (1) providing livelihood skills training for an estimated 1,000 women and 2,000 young men; (2) providing cash-for-work for an estimated 3,000 people to carry out quick impact community development projects, such as repairing infrastructure, rehabilitating public spaces and installing solar lighting to improve safety; (3) establishing a multi-purpose women’s centre for skills training for women and adolescent girls in the camps where Rohingya people have settled; (4) providing information on sexual and gender-based violence, and sexual and reproductive health and rights, human trafficking and child marriage to reach an estimated 6,000 women per year; (5) providing skills training for approximately 360 women per year; and (6) establishing a Local Volunteer Mediators Network. Setting up this Network comprises training local officials, traditional leaders, women’s groups and media on mediation and dispute resolution; and holding workshops on the prevention of violent extremism, and on peacebuilding from a gender perspective.</description>

    <title>Emergency Assistance in Specific Countries - International Organization for Migration 2018</title>
    <description>January 2018 - This grant represents Canada's support to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the following countries:  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DRC, CAR, Libya, Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen. IOM provides humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, migrants, and host communities. IOM provides assistance in multiple sectors, including protection, shelter, emergency non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene services, livelihoods and camp coordination and management.  With the support of Canada and other donors, IOM is facilitating access to essential relief items and adequate living conditions for crisis-affected populations as well as vulnerable populations, including IDPs, refugees, migrants, returnees, and host communities. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency shelter kits, non-food items and multi-purpose cash; (2) coordinating camp management for internally displaced people in UN bases; (3) deploying mobile teams to remote locations where affected populations lack water, sanitation and hygiene services; (4) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene; (5) supporting humanitarian organizations by establishing lightweight camps in deep field locations and heavy base camps and national NGO support centres and providing common transport services of cargo for humanitarian organizations; (6) data collection including mapping of vulnerable populations at points of entry and at the district and community level for enhanced targeting and delivery of assistance; and (7) protection and gender mainstreaming across activities with provision for extremely vulnerable individuals including unaccompanied migrant children and single females.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Quality Education for Children in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve learning for pre-primary, primary-aged and out-of-school girls and boys in the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh through gender equitable quality education. Cox’s Bazar is one of Bangladesh’s poorest and most vulnerable districts, with poverty well above the country’s national average. The influx of over 740,000 Rohingya refugees since August 2017 has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources, including for jobs and income, among the Rohingya and the local communities, as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation is particularly difficult for women and children who are the most vulnerable.  The project aims to: (1) work to make schools safer for children, while improving gender sensitivity in teaching; (2) improve learning assessment practices; (3) strengthen school leadership while helping to make leaders more gender-sensitive; (4) provide a comprehensive gender-sensitive school effectiveness package; (5) contribute to gender-equitable quality education for 102,000 children (54,000 girls); and (6) build the capacity of teachers, school leaders and community members in the host communities of Cox’s Bazar.  Project activities include : (1) providing professional development packages for teachers covering topics such as lesson planning, class management, and age and gender-sensitive teaching practices; (2) providing learning supplies to 120,000 girls and boys in host communities; (3) developing and supporting the implementation of school-level improvement plans, including school grants, to make schools more friendly to girls and to children with disabilities; (4) supporting the  development of disaster management plans and standard operating procedures in schools; (5) increasing the capacity of communities to support inclusive education through Parent Teachers Associations, with an emphasis on the importance of girls’ education; and (6) developing and implementing a gender-sensitive capacity building plan for district leaders and school leaders.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved gender-sensitive teaching and assessment practices adopted by trained teachers in targeted schools in host communities; (2) increased access to equitable education and learning opportunities by early learners and girls and boys in Cox's Bazar District, including by those affected by emergencies; and (3) improved district and sub-district level systems for planning, supervision and monitoring of gender-sensitive education.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) provided technical support to the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MoPME) in planning and implementing the School and Classroom-based Assessment (SCBA) policy pilot (2020-2021). Also completed the data analysis, report writing and reviews, and revision of manuals and tools; (2) trained more than 100 teachers from 100 host community primary schools in applying the SCBA in their schools. Training included theory and principles of applying gender-sensitive teaching methods under SCBA; (3) identified critical understaffing of the Primary Teacher Training Institute (PTI) (12 out of 17 posts vacant) as a major reason for a lack of qualified new teachers. This was remedied by the recruitment of 12 instructors to support the teacher training institute’s ability to function effectively; (4) trained 195 teachers (98 women and 97 men) who obtained their Diploma in Primary Education (DPEd). The training successfully transitioned to remote learning in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions; (5) supported 300 schools in Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Chokoria, Ramu and Ukhyia upazilas, and reaching 134,902 children (70,653 girls and 64,249 boys); (6) supported the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) Office to capacitate School Management Committees (SMCs) in 537 government primary schools in the host community. This strengthened the understanding of their roles and responsibilities to support equitable learning for boys and girls; (7) developed the capacity of 537 SMCs (including training on disaster risk reduction) through the Department of Primary Education Office, reaching 537 head teachers (189 females and 348 males); and (8) 593 government primary schools from Cox’s Bazar developed School-Level Improvement Plans (SLIP). They received grants for implementation, benefitting 151,769 students.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Rural Social Protection: Productive Safety Net Program 2018-2019</title>
    <description>This project represents Canada's continuing support for Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSPN). Led by the Government of Ethiopia, with support from Canada and other partners, this initiative aims to enhance household and community resilience to shocks, such as droughts, and improve household food security, nutrition and economic well-being in Ethiopia's most vulnerable communities. To achieve these objectives, PSNP provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers. In exchange for these transfers, PSNP beneficiaries participate in public works activities to build community assets and improve watershed management; a number of these activities build resilience to climate change. The most vulnerable beneficiaries (e.g. elderly people and pregnant and lactating mothers) receive transfers without contributing their labour for public works. The project reach is up to 10 million rural beneficiaries.  Project activities include: (1) providing cash and food transfers to food insecure households; (2) conducting livelihoods interventions (e.g. crop and livestock production, and off-farm income generating activities); (3) providing key health and nutrition services (e.g. behaviour change communication activities), (4) construction of community assets (e.g. land rehabilitation, health posts); and (5) offering capacity development activities.  Canada's support to this program is provided through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)and the World Bank.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected intermediate outcomes for this project include: (1) enhanced livelihoods and resilience to shocks for rural female/male headed households vulnerable to food insecurity; and (2) food security and nutrition improved for rural female/male headed households vulnerable to food insecurity.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of August 2018 include: (1) provided timely food transfers to food insecure people affected by the drought crisis in Ethiopia. This funding covered the provision of food (cereals and pulses) over an additional period of two months to food insecure households, with a particular focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, including pregnant and lactating women, and young children; and (2) met the needs of up to 318,170 PSNP beneficiaries affected by the drought. These results have contributed to an enhanced livelihood and resilience to shocks for rural households affected by food insecurity. These results have also contributed to an improved food security and nutrition for rural households.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Ensuring meaningful engagement through reform for gender equality</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve Ukraine’s institutional, legal and political environment to address harmful, embedded gender norms, stereotypes and practices. It aims to break down barriers such as discrimination and exclusion that prevent women and marginalized groups from running for political and institutional leadership. The project also directly supports the participation of women as civic and institutional leaders, politicians, and voters. It works to raise public awareness about the importance of inclusivity and gender equality at both the societal and individual levels. The project works with Civil society groups, including women’s organizations, media outlets, members of Verkhovna Rada (the Parliament of Ukraine) and the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. It does so to empower and build their capacity to advocate for sustainable inclusivity and gender equality. Project activities include: (1) conducting short and long-term training sessions and providing technical and advisory services to the Central Election Commission of Ukraine; (2) capacity-building for civil society organizations advocating for inclusive recovery programs; and (3) providing sub-grants, advocacy, technology solutions, research, professional development, and technical leadership support to professional networks and communities of practice.  In response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, They adapted certain project activities to address new immediate needs and protect previous development gains. Canada’s development partners in Ukraine pivoted project activities to respond to the evolving context in several ways, such as providing emergency supplies, equipment, and services along with support for mental health, transportation and accommodation. The beneficiaries, scope, expected results and geographic location of project activities may have changed from the original description.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased participation of women and other marginalised groups in civic, political, and electoral activities in Ukraine; and (2) strengthened participation of marginalised groups and of women in Ukraine's civic and political processes.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of March 2024 include: (1) helped civil society actors advocate for amendments to the electoral code to ensure the inclusion of gender equality considerations. The amendments included maintaining a gender quota for political candidates and lowering the financial deposit required for local elections. These adopted amendments helped increase the participation of women candidates; (2) strengthened the capacity of local civil society organizations to advocate for inclusive reforms successfully adopted into law. The reforms advocated for the granting voting rights to internally displaced peoples and internal migrants, improving election accessibility for voters with disabilities, and ensuring that political parties comply with legal requirements to improve gender representation within their parties; (3) supported Ukraine’s election management body in adopting Resolution 90 in August 2022. This provides them effective oversight to monitor political finance violations by establishing a legal framework for developing electronic reporting modules for political parties and candidates in national, regional, and local elections; (4) trained 10,850 students (5,003 men and 5,847 women) in civic education courses. As a result, over 70% of participants engaged more actively in civic life, helping to promote positive change in their communities and at the national level; (5) launched an online international education course called "Allies for equality" in February 2022. This course aims at enhancing the leadership skills of 61 internally displaced men and women, promoting partnership between men and women, and addressing different forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (6) developed the “Men as Allies” guide and distributed 300 copies to KYIV city council members and administration officials to encourage men to actively support women’s equal political participation; and (7) engaged 66 journalists (25 men and 41 women) on gender equality, inclusion, human rights, and other political and electoral topics through project initiatives.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Strengthening SRHR and GVB Prevention in Host Communities of Cox's Bazar</title>
    <description>The project aims to provide equitable sexual and reproductive health care and respond to gender-based violence (GBV) for people living in local communities of Cox’s Bazar impacted by the influx of over 740,000 Rohingya refugees since August 2017. Cox’s Bazar is one of Bangladesh’s poorest and most vulnerable districts, with poverty well above the country’s national average. The influx of Rohingya has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources, including jobs and income among the Rohingya and the existing Bangleshi communities where the refugees are camped, as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation is particularly difficult for women and children who are the most vulnerable. The project works to improve the accessibility to GBV and psychosocial services in public health facilities and women-friendly spaces for survivors of GBV. Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness and use of services by survivors through outreach activities; (2) building the self-reliance skills of 4,000 women with information on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), functional numeracy and literacy skills, nutrition and core life skills; (3) engaging 30,000 community members through implementing, for the first time in Bangladesh, the SASA! (Start, Awareness, Support, Action) community mobilization strategy for raising awareness and preventing GBV; and (4) developing a community-based GBV response and prevention program, including engagement with men and boys for their role in protecting families and communities from GBV. Benefiting over 500,000 women and girls, the project supports the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in: (1) strengthening public health facilities to provide high-quality midwifery and emergency obstetric care; (2) increasing the availability of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, including family planning, contraception and treatment of STIs and HIV; and (3) developing training materials and providing training for health care providers on GBV response and treatment of survivors.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) provided technical support to the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MoPME) in planning and implementing the School and Classroom-based Assessment (SCBA) policy pilot (2020-2021). Also completed the data analysis, report writing and reviews, and revision of manuals and tools; (2) trained more than 100 teachers from 100 host community primary schools in applying the SCBA in their schools. Training included theory and principles of applying gender-sensitive teaching methods under SCBA; (3) identified critical understaffing of the Primary Teacher Training Institute (PTI) (12 out of 17 posts vacant) as a major reason for a lack of qualified new teachers. This was remedied by the recruitment of 12 instructors to support the teacher training institute’s ability to function effectively; (4) trained 195 teachers (98 women and 97 men) who obtained their Diploma in Primary Education (DPEd). The training successfully transitioned to remote learning in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions; (5) supported 300 schools in Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Chokoria, Ramu and Ukhyia upazilas, and reaching 134,902 children (70,653 girls and 64,249 boys); (6) supported the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) Office to capacitate School Management Committees (SMCs) in 537 government primary schools in the host community. This strengthened the understanding of their roles and responsibilities to support equitable learning for boys and girls; (7) developed the capacity of 537 SMCs (including training on disaster risk reduction) through the Department of Primary Education Office, reaching 537 head teachers (189 females and 348 males); and (8) 593 government primary schools from Cox’s Bazar developed School-Level Improvement Plans (SLIP). They received grants for implementation, benefitting 151,769 students.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Increasing Women's Participation in United Nations Peace Operations</title>
    <description>This project aims to support the long-term positive impact of increasing uniformed women’s meaningful participation in United Nations (UN) Peace Operations, through improved policies and programming at the local, national and global levels. Although governments and the UN have been making concrete commitments to increase women’s participation, these commitments have not yet yielded sufficient results. In order to effect positive change, research and advocacy are needed to ensure that recommendations, policies and programming are grounded in evidence-based analysis. Project activities include: (1) conducting consultations and workshops with UN Peace Operations practitioners and experts to validate methodologies and approaches for researching women’s involvement in UN Peace Operations; (2) producing a survey instrument to collect data on the experiences and needs of uniformed women peacekeepers; (3) producing research publications based on analysis, and providing policy recommendations to increase and best support women’s meaningful participation in UN Peace Operations; and (4) conducting policy forums and outreach to raise visibility and foster a shared understanding of research results, analyses and recommendations to increase uniformed women’s meaningful participation in UN Peace Operations.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) enhanced decision-making by UN officials and members of state to address factors contributing to meaningful participation of uniformed women in UN Peace Operations; and (2) improved effectiveness of interventions by the UN, national governments, and civil society organizations to increase the meaningful participation of uniformed women in UN Peace Operations.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of September 2022 include: (1) increased body of knowledge through research publications on various factors affecting women's meaningful participation in UN Peace Operations. The International Peace Institute ((IPI)) published one issue brief and two policy papers on various topics in line with the meaningful participation of women in Peace Operations with wide circulation. The three key publications include: (a) an issue brief on "Perceptions and Lived Realities of Women Police Officers in UN Peace Operations," published in June 2021; (b) a policy paper on "From Female Engagement Teams to Engagement Platoons: The Evolution of Gendered Community Engagement in UN Peace Operations," published in November 2021; and (c) a policy paper on "Uniformed Women and Gender Responsive Leadership" was published in February 2022; and (2) increased decision-makers knowledge on policies affecting women's meaningful participation in UN peace operations. IPI organized research workshops attended by more than 20 Member States, UN officials, and civil society representatives. These stakeholders discussed barriers and incentives affecting the meaningful participation of uniformed women in UN peace operations and encouraged global research and learning. Some of the discussions included: (a) a research workshop with three sessions held in December 2021 on the subject Host Communities Gendered Perceptions of UN Peace Operations; and (b) IPI organized a public policy forum to launch the policy report "From Female Engagement Teams to Engagement Platoons: The Evolution of Gendered Community Engagement in UN Peace Operations." in January 2022.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) - Institutional Support 2018-2019</title>
    <description>This grant is Canada's long-term institutional support for the International Organisation of La Francophonie (IOF). IOF uses these funds, as well as those of other donors, to carry out its mandate. The IOF's mandate includes: (1) the promotion of the French language and cultural and linguistic diversity; (2) the promotion of peace, democracy and human rights; (3) support for education, training, higher education and research; and (4) the promotion of sustainable economic development and solidarity. The IOF aims to incorporate the transversal axes of youth and gender equality into the implementation of its strategic objectives. The IOF conducts its activities with other institutions of the Francophonie, civil society and national, international and multilateral organizations. It delivers its programming through advocacy, project funding, technical assistance, training, awareness-raising and the dissemination of knowledge in French. Through its Strategic Framework 2015-2022, the IOF aims to place the action of La Francophonie in the international context of the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Canada's support for IOF programming contributes, in particular, to the enhancement of the French language in a context of linguistic and cultural diversity, the strengthening of democratic governance and the rule of law among its members, the strengthening of access for all children to quality education and training, and the development of the Post-2015 Development Agenda.</description>

    <title>Action for Girls’ and Young Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Mozambique</title>
    <description>This project seeks to improve gender equality in the provinces of Nampula and Zambézia by promoting and helping to realize adolescent girls’ and young women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in Mozambique. The project works at accomplishing this by empowering the poorest and most vulnerable adolescent girls’ and young women with knowledge, skills and access to SRHR services. The project also aims to increase their communities' commitment and support to protect girls’ and women’s rights by engaging boys, men, families and communities to change discriminatory socio-cultural norms and behaviours.  Project activities include: (1) promoting life skills and SRHR through the use of safe spaces, peer mentoring and girls' clubs; (2) training local sexual and reproductive health service providers to meet girls' and young women's needs; (3) educating family members, community religious leaders, and boys and men on the importance of girls' education and their SRHR; (4) improving SRHR policies and programming capacity through improved data, monitoring and evaluation and coordination; and (5) amplifying confidential access to SRHR information for girls and young women through innovative use of communications technologies, such as online interactive counselling and text messaging.  The project contributes to improving gender equality and the realization of SRHR for about 1.2 million girls and young women in the provinces of Nampula and Zambézia.</description>

    <title>Combatting Impunity through Justice in the Great Lakes Region</title>
    <description>This project aims to build accountability for international crimes and grave violations of human rights committed in the context of the armed conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi. The project works to strengthen the justice systems of these countries by engaging with actors both inside (i.e.: judges, prosecutors and police) and outside (i.e.: lawyers, NGOs and human rights defenders) their legal systems.  The goal is to increase their capacity to professionally investigate, document and prosecute conflict-related crimes and serious human rights violations, including sexual and gender-based violence crimes, ultimately contributing to increased accountability, as well as more effective justice systems.</description>

    <title>Women's Voice and Leadership - Tanzania - Women Fund Tanzania (WFT)</title>
    <description>This project is part of Canada’s Women’s Voice and Leadership Program, which supports local and regional women’s organisations and networks that are working to promote women’s rights, and advance women’s empowerment and gender equality in developing countries. This is done by supporting their activities, building their institutional capacity, and promoting network and alliance-building as women’s rights and feminist organizations are critical agents of change. The Program also responds to the globally recognized, significant gap in funding and support to women’s rights organizations and movements around the world. The project has two components, implemented by two Tanzanian women’s rights’ organizations (WROs), the Women Fund Tanzania and the Tanzania Gender Networking Programme (TGNP). This component implemented by the Women Fund Tanzania (WFT) aims to reach over 100 national, regional, district and local WROs in Tanzania. WFT’s focus is providing small, mid-sized and larger sub-grants to local WROs, along with project management and program delivery training, as well as mentorship throughout the sub-grantees’ project cycle. Grant selection is based on feminist principles, ensuring maximum reach and supporting organizations working on a variety of key sectors including health, education and land rights in different regions of the country. WFT also supports the development of networks and alliances between WROs, coordinated advocacy activities and coalitions on specific issues including sextortion.</description>

    <title>Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health in the Middle East - UNFPA 2019-2021</title>
    <description>June 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and refugees facing protracted displacement in host countries continue to face acute humanitarian needs in Jordan and Lebanon.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is contributing to meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable women and girls in sexual and reproductive health, and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. The project operates in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency obstetric care, and sexual and reproductive health services; (2) ensuring protection from and response to gender-based violence; and (3) providing health services, supplies, commodities and medication, dignity kits, and reproductive health kits to crisis-affected people.</description>

    <title>Expert Deployment Mechanism for Trade and Development</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce poverty in developing countries by expanding trade and investment to create jobs and achieve growth that works for everyone. The project responds to requests for technical assistance from developing countries by providing a wide range of assistance prior to, during, and following the negotiations of free trade agreement (FTA) or foreign investment promotion and protection agreement (FIPA) with Canada. Project activities include: (1) helping to address the development aspects of priority trade issues in the lead-up to FTA/FIPA negotiations; (2) improving the ability of developing country governments to take into account the perspectives of poor populations when negotiating a FTA/FIPA; (3) supporting trade associations in developing countries to identify the economic and poverty impacts of FTAs/FIPAs; and (4) helping local, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) increase their competitiveness in light of new trade and investment regimes, in order to expand employment opportunities for the poor.</description>

    <title>Empowering Youth Through Rights-Based Comprehensive Sexuality Education</title>
    <description>This project aims to empower young women and girls to exercise their rights to make free and informed choices about their sexuality and well-being in Bolivia, Kenya and Togo. The project partner, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), is a federation of Member Associations (MAs). The IPPF has identified 3 MAs to become Centres of Excellence over the course of the project.  The project supports the establishment of these three Centres of Excellence in Bolivia, Kenya and Togo for gender-integrated and rights-based youth-centred sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) programs for the Latin American, Anglophone and Francophone African regions.  The project enables the three International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Member Associations to: 1) improve access to comprehensive sexuality education programs and SRH services that are gender-integrated, rights-based and youth centred; 2) improve the quality of CSE programs so that they are rights-based and gender equality-focused including information on how to address harmful gender norms, providing tools for girls and young women to be empowered in their relationships; and reducing incidence of early marriage and pregnancy; and 3) develop the capacity of the IPPF Member Associations to support regional programming that is rights-based and youth-centred, as part of their capacity as a Center of Excellence. These efforts aim to decrease risks to young women, improve their sexual and reproductive health and rights, and enhance their life opportunities.</description>

    <title>Simba Utano: Equality and Dignity for Girls and Young Women in Zimbabwe</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the health of adolescent girls and young women at risk of HIV in priority districts in Zimbabwe. Based on the concept of Simba Utano, which means “health is power” in the Shona language, the project increases knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and HIV prevention among vulnerable adolescent girls and women, as well as their families and communities. The project also works with health service providers and others to build their capacity to provide quality, gender-responsive services and to build a supportive environment to strengthen HIV response in the project area. Project activities include: (1) establishing networks of trained peer educators/community leaders to provide information about SRHR and HIV prevention; (2) training health workers on gender-transformative and adolescent-responsive SRHR and HIV approaches; (3) training health facility managers and health officials on integrated SRHR and HIV services; and (4) enhancing knowledge management of SRHR and HIV response in order to strengthen HIV response.</description>

    <title>School Feeding Platform: Breaking Barriers to Girls' Education</title>
    <description>With GAC’s support, the World Food Programme (WFP), UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) are working jointly in emergency contexts in Chad and Niger, using WFP’s new school feeding platform to better meet the different needs of children and adolescent girls, specifically barriers to education.  A gender-responsive approach is taken to ensure girls and adolescent girls in particular are enrolled in and stay in school. All children are provided with nutritious, fortified school meals, integrated school health packages, including education services about nutrition and health as well as about sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence (GBV).  In addition, adolescent girls receive additional targeted support to address their specific needs and barriers including the provision of micronutrients, conditional cash incentives, services and support related to sexual and reproductive health rights, and tailored support in school, including mentoring and coaching.</description>

    <title>Emergency Country-Specific Funding in the Middle East - ICRC Appeals 2019-2021</title>
    <description>July 2019 – Humanitarian needs stemming from the crises in Syria and Iraq remain significant throughout the Middle East. Continued violence in Syria raises little prospects for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of over 5.6 million refugees in the region. Internally displaced persons range in the millions in Syria and Iraq, and humanitarian needs are acute for refugees facing protracted displacement in Jordan and Lebanon.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s humanitarian operations in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon aim to provide protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing Red Cross/Red Crescent National Societies with technical expertise to strengthen their capacity in areas such as promoting international humanitarian law, restoring family links, and delivering relief in situations of armed conflict and violence; and (3) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees.</description>

    <title>Making Trade Work for Women in Africa</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs working in the areas of apparel, textile, fashion accessories and home décor in Lesotho, Uganda, Madagascar and Ethiopia.  The project works to provide training and technical assistance so women-led enterprises can increase their exports to Canada and other foreign markets.  The project also aims to assist local trade support institutions (TSIs) to provide gender responsive market access services, and ensure women-owned enterprises are accessing those services and implementing export plans for Canadian and other foreign markets.  Project activities include: (1) providing training and technical assistance on market access services to women-led enterprises; (2) providing training and technical assistance to local TSIs on sustainable business plans, which include new revenue generating services and funding opportunities from local and international funders; and (3) providing training and technical assistance to women-led enterprises to increase their access to the financial and human resources necessary to implement their export plans.  The project aims to directly benefit 240 women-owned/led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that work to access gender responsive market services to access Canadian and other foreign markets, and 60 local TSI staff to receive training and technical assistance on self-sustaining governance structures that promote women leadership and gender responsive market access services to women led/owned SMEs in the targeted countries.</description>

    <title>Support to the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report</title>
    <description>The project aims to contribute to inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, as outlined in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). The Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report) is an editorially independent report, established in 2002, to monitor progress towards the international education agenda targets. The GEM Report provides analysis on different regions focusing on specific issues such as gender, education in conflict situations, migration and skill for youth, which permits a comparison between education systems at the global scale. Based on a rigorous review and analysis of both qualitative and quantitative research and data, the GEM Report provides a breadth of understanding on progress and challenges in education that serves to inform and hold global, regional and national education stakeholders accountable. The GEM Report also serves as a basis for evidence-based advocacy to promote progress towards achieving the education targets set out in SDG4, including through acting as convener, and brokering dialogue on education issues with policy makers, academics, education stakeholders and young people, to effect policy changes. Project activities include: (1) the publication of three annual editions of the global report (2020, 2021, 2022) and its associated products; (2) publishing the regional reports; (3) publishing the gender equality report; (4) publishing policy papers; and (5) supporting the GEM Report’s advocacy work.</description>

    <title>Education Cannot Wait - Institutional Support 2019-2022</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to Education Cannot Wait (ECW). ECW uses these funds, along with other donor’s funding to achieve its mandate.  ECW is the only global fund designed to deliver rapid, flexible support to address gaps in financing, capacity and coordination to ensure that girls and boys in crisis situations have access to quality education. ECW is hosted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and is administered under UNICEF's financial, human resources and administrative rules and regulations, while operations are run by an independent ECW Secretariat.  ECW is the first global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. It was established during the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 by international humanitarian and development aid actors, along with public and private donors.  Based on the recognition that continuous access to quality learning is a priority for children and families affected by conflicts, natural disasters and displacement and that no organization can do it alone, ECW comes as a ground-breaking initiative bringing together public and private partners eager to work together differently and mobilise the funding required to deploy immediate and sustainable programmes tailor-made to the educational needs of these children.  ECW focuses on mobilizing governments, and humanitarian and development actors to raise predictable, multi-year financing, build the capacity of national and global actors, and improve coordination of education responses to crisis. ECW supports activities designed to meet education needs for crises-affected children and youth between the ages of 3 and 18.  ECW supports activities such as the provision of learning materials and psychosocial support, school and classroom equipment and infrastructure, teacher training and support as well as non-formal education programs. ECW aims to reach 8 million affected children and youth by 2021, including those with disabilities, improving their learning outcomes and enhancing their socio-emotional well-being and employability.</description>

    <title>Youth Employability: Closing the Gender Gap in Youth Employment in Nicaragua</title>
    <description>The project aims to reduce poverty and contribute to closing the gender gap in youth employment by improving the job readiness and employability of 12,000 youth, including 7,200 young women. In Nicaragua, youth aged 15 to 29 are disproportionately affected by unemployment. Young women face additional challenges and are more likely to work informally and under vulnerable conditions.  The project employs a youth-centered model that includes: (1) providing gender sensitive technical and life-skills trainings and raising youth awareness on labour-related issues; (2) providing job search trainings and creating/strengthening networks to increase youth access to job information and/or entrepreneurship opportunities; and (3) increasing youth participation in public space and networks by fostering alliances with the private and public sectors in the search for employment.  As women are under-represented in the labour market and earn significantly less than men (55% of male salaries in urban areas and 24% in rural areas), the project integrates specific actions that address gender-specific barriers in gaining and retaining employment. These actions include among others: gender-sensitive training material and methods, public campaigns and awareness raising sessions for employers, and raising young women’s voices in public space and networks, while engaging men on gender issues.</description>

    <title>Support to MINUSMA Trust Fund - Mali</title>
    <description>The Trust Fund in Support of Peace and Security in Mali, through the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) provides support to Malian-led efforts to resolve the crisis and support the implementation of the Algiers Peace Process signed in July 2015.  Progress in implementing key provisions of the Algiers Accord, has been slow, in particular due to continuing insecurity and armed resistance. Continuing instability in Mali has a significant impact on the whole Sahel region.  The contribution of Canada to the Trust Fund aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement, the restoration of state authority to the north of Mali, reinforcement of social cohesion in view of reducing inter- and intra-community tensions, improve the protection of civilians, and contribute to the security of the north and central Mali.</description>

    <title>Support to the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement Secretariat - 2019-2021</title>
    <description>The Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement Secretariat plays a coordination and facilitative role for the SUN Movement in order to improve nutrition outcomes in developing countries, particularly for women and children under five, in the 61 member countries and states. It also tracks the SUN Movement’s successes, and seeks to ensure that SUN countries receive the support they need to achieve their nutrition objectives. This project supports the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement Secretariat. The SUN Movement is a global convening mechanism for stakeholders in global nutrition with the aim to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition. It includes 61 countries and 4 Indian States that are leading a global movement to end malnutrition in all its forms. The main function of the SUN Movement Secretariat is to coordinate efforts within the SUN Movement, and ensure that SUN countries receive the support they need to achieve their nutrition objectives. The work of the Secretariat is guided by the vision of the SUN Lead Group, members of which are high-level leaders committed to nutrition. Project activities include: (1) supporting the SUN Movement Secretariat  Programme of Work, as indicated in their 2016-2020 Strategic Plan, to ensure the transition to Phase III of SUN for several key areas of work including: support to SUN countries; liaison with various networks, the Lead Group and the Executive Committee; communication and advocacy; and monitoring and evaluation; (2) supporting the completion of the Strategic Review, and the drafting/implementation of the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan which works to make recommendations on the vision, strategy, capabilities and structure of the next phase of the Movement (2021-2025); and (3) convening a process to ensure the SUN pooled fund is fit for purpose and contributes to the delivery of the SUN Strategy 3.0. The pooled fund is a source of grant funding to support in-country activities at the national and subnational levels to scale up nutrition. The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) administers the SUN pooled fund and grants.</description>

    <title>Capacity Development Support for Integrated Mine Action in Eastern Ukraine</title>
    <description>The project aims to support the Government of Ukraine in establishing a comprehensive, well coordinated, and gender-sensitive mine action response. The project also works  to provide strategic capacity development support for mine action to enhance integrated planning, coordination, and operational efficiencies amongst the different mine action stakeholders presently active at national level and in eastern Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts). Project activities include: (1) enhancing mine risks prevention through an improved education framework; (2) improving mine action information management, through a system of systematic local information gathering, and feeding into the Information Management System for Mine Action ; (3) establishing effective capacities (including planning procedures and support service packages) for mines clearance and assistance to mines’ survivors; (4) providing advice and capacity building to new mine action centres (national and regional) as per the recently passed legislation; and (5) continuing effective coordination of mine action operational activities in support of the Government of Ukraine through the Protection Cluster (Mine Action sub-cluster).</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) conflict affected communities benefit from strengthened community security and sustained peace; (2) women, girls, men, and boys in territories affected, or at risk of being affected by landmines and explosive remnants of war  in conflict affected areas enjoy equal access to quality age, gender, and disability sensitive services; and (3) the capacities of Ukrainian mine action institutions at the national level and in eastern Ukraine as well as territorial communities and civil society are developed to effectively plan, deliver, and coordinate mine action activities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (June 2023) include: (1) provided relevant equipment to the mine action centres. This supports humanitarian clearance activities and the personnel capacity through targeted capacity developing activities; (2) provided the operational staff of the Ministry of Defence’s National Mine Action Centre with a series of specialized courses prescribed by Ukrainian legislation. This enables the staff to conduct accreditation and quality inspections of mine action operators; (3) provided 7,068 people ( 61% women and girls) residing in 130 settlements in Donetsk and Luhansk regions with explosive ordnance risk education sessions. 72 settlements participated through online sessions; (4) developed a gender handbook for Mine Action Operators to provide guidelines on gender mainstreaming in four components of mine action: demining, explosive ordnance risk awareness, advocacy, and victim assistance; and (5) developed and launched an online training platform to increase the capacity of mine risk education trainers.</resultsAchieved>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved quality, relevance and gender-responsiveness of recruit and in-service training offered by the PPA, and other training units of the National Police of Ukraine (NPU); and (2) increased trust and cooperation between the NPU and civil society in target areas, especially in rural communities.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (May 2023) include: (1) facilitated operations and expansion of the training programs at three police academies. These programs include distance learning, scenario-based training, and integrating gender strategies into practical operations; (2) encouraged the continued application of community policing principles by establishing a policing network (online platform). This network unites 1,700+ police and community representatives who share tools and best practices related to community policing; (3) supported advocacy of gender equality throughout policing operations and promoted women leaders through the sustainability of the Ukrainian Association of Women in Law Enforcement (UAWLE) as a professional network with 500+ members; (4) created a national psychological health strategy and network of police psychological health peer practitioners who continue supporting front-line officers; and (5) expanded the understanding and role of police in responding to heightened incidents of domestic violence. This is through developing learning resources and increasing the capacity of police to work amongst local stakeholders (shelters, social services, legal advisors) to address domestic violence.</resultsAchieved>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased skills of the National Police of Ukraine at addressing crimes against LBGTI people in an appropriate and sensitive manner; (2) increased recognition and awareness by decision-makers of human rights violations carried out against LGBTI persons; and (3) increased knowledge of civil society organizations on promoting human rights of LGBTI persons and engaging with law enforcement bodies.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (June 2023) include: (1) developed a human rights training curriculum on inclusive policing focusing on hate crime investigation. It aims to challenge bias-motivated crimes of homophobia and transphobia directed against lesbian transgender and intersex, gay, bisexual (LGBTI) populations in Ukraine; (2) trained 74 police investigators in six full-day human rights and inclusion workshops; (3) developed and transferred an e-curriculum for police academies, titled “A Human Rights Approach to Policing: An Introduction to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC) -Based Discrimination and Protections” to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine; (4) developed a hate crime investigation handbook titled "An Introduction to SOGIESC-Based Discrimination and Human Rights Protection in Policing". It aims to systemically strengthen hate crime investigation and prosecution against LGBTI communities in Ukraine; and (5) provided immediate support to members of LGBTI communities in response to the full-scale invasion. This led to relocating 16 people, providing 18 persons access to safe spaces and shelters, and providing 32 individuals with psychosocial support .</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Measuring Gender Impacts on Operational Effectiveness of UN Peace Operations</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the effectiveness of United Nations (UN) operations to protect civilians, particularly women and girls, in fragile and conflict-affected states, by providing decision makers with evidence based knowledge on gender and peacekeeping. The project works to collect, analyse, and distill the contributions made by uniformed women in peacekeeping operations that have influenced peacekeeping mandate outcomes. The UN and Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) aim to use this information to make improved gender equality informed decisions, with respect to increasing the number of women in peace operations, and creating a receptive environment for women in uniform. Project activities include: (1) conducting extensive and in-depth academic research to gather and analyse information on operational effectiveness; (2) organizing field visits and interviews with key stakeholders; and (3) providing advocacy and sensitisation activities.</description>

    <title>Supporting Girls to be Safe to Learn</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve learning outcomes for women and girls in fragile and conflict-afflicted settings. The project supports the Safe to Learn Campaign, a global, inter-agency and multi-country initiative, dedicated to ending violence in and around schools, so children are free to learn, thrive and pursue their dreams. The project focuses on addressing violence as a barrier to girls’ education, and providing support for developing materials to enhance the integration of gender equality across the Safe to Learn Campaign.   Project activities include: (1) increasing the knowledge and capacity of girls and boys, teachers, administrators, community members and religious leaders, to recognize the impact of violence in and around schools; (2) promoting positive gender equitable norms and preventing harassment through the use of positive discipline, and addressing gender stereotypes in communities; (3) strengthening education and child protection systems to be gender responsive by preventing sexual and gender-based violence in and around schools; and (4) empowering girls and boys by engaging them in the design and delivery of solutions to prevent and respond to violence through life skills education.</description>

    <title>Implementing the Maputo Accord for Peace and Reconciliation in Mozambique</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to a future of peace and reconciliation in Mozambique with no resurgence of military hostilities between the Government and Renamo (opposition group). This project works to support peace and reconciliation activities, such as the demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) of 5,000 former combatants, and augment the reconciliation strategy towards peaceful, sustainable governance throughout the country. The project also aims to provide a diverse range of capabilities including technical, logistical and administrative support to both the peace and DDR processes. These include a particular focus on gender, and facilitates the reintegration of Renamo ex-combatants into society.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthened gender response in policies and legislation to address key barriers to women’s economic participation; (2) increased market access for medium and small businesses; (3) enhanced leadership and business management skills for women entrepreneurs in the agro-food sector; (4) increased access to upgraded technology and matching grants for farming families; (5) increased knowledge and skills in good agricultural practices and in quality and safe products for farming families; (6) increased knowledge and skills in environmental sustainability for businesses; and (7) strengthened ability for youth to be matched to work placements.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (March 2024): (1) strengthened gender-responsive legislation by amending 4 laws and regulations that previously discriminated against women's rights and economic participation. These amendments were the result of a comprehensive assessment of 10 laws and regulations, coupled with insights gathered from consultations with 119 stakeholders, including parliamentarians, representatives from the public and private sectors, academia, labour unions, civil society organizations, and businesses; (2) supported 283 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), including 217 women-led businesses, to improve their access to local and international markets. This support included providing market intelligence through various e-portals, such as those detailing food safety requirements, legal and quality standards for international markets, and agri-food investment opportunities; (3) supported 40 MSMEs (54% women-led) in enhancing their knowledge and skills to improve environmental practices, with 93% expressing satisfaction with the support received; (4) enhanced the agricultural practices of 406 farmers (61% women) through participation in training on good agricultural practices and occupational safety and health, with 70% adopting environmentally sustainable agricultural practices for safer, higher-quality produce; (5) strengthened the entrepreneurship abilities of 218 entrepreneurs (95% women), with 20 of them  fully developing their business idea; (6) strengthened the abilities and skills of 517 vulnerable youth (57% women) through a workplace learning program that included internships and apprenticeships.  This facilitated the transition of 77 vulnerable youth (49% women), with 56% being Lebanese and 44% Syrian, from education to employment; and (7) created 1,117 jobs (78% women) with the retention of 1,344 jobs (60% women).</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Sexual Health and Empowerment - Philippines</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women and girls in remote and conflict-affected regions in the Philippines. The project is supporting the Government of the Philippines in its fight against coronavirus (COVID-19), by addressing the heightened vulnerabilities of women and girls to unwanted pregnancies and gender-based violence (GBV) during the pandemic. The project aims to expand ongoing outreach services through mobile clinics for obstetric, prenatal, and postnatal care, including family planning (FP) services. These outreach services also aim to cover the procurement of dignity kits and FP commodities. The project also works to augment existing response activities, such as the procurement of personal protective equipment, the establishment of a SRHR and GBV emergency hotline, and the distribution of COVID-19 information materials.  Project activities include: (1) increasing the knowledge, skills, and capacities of women, girls, and boys; (2) working with influencers to change negative social norms on SRHR and gender-based violence (GBV); and (3) enhancing the capacity of the health system to provide comprehensive and gender-sensitive health information and services. The project is supporting local women’s rights organizations in improving their organizational capacity, and their ability to conduct learning and research initiatives in support of SRHR and GBV advocacies and policies at the national and local levels.  Through the project, over 86,400 women and girls, as well as men and boys, are expected to benefit from improved quality, availability, and access to SRH information and services, in line with the implementation of the Philippine Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law.</description>

    <title>Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy: Sexual and Reproductive Health for Adolescent Development</title>
    <description>The project aims to reduce the incidence of early pregnancy in Nicaragua, by promoting and strengthening an integrated approach to adolescent development, respecting adolescents’ decisions and freedoms, expanding their capacities and opportunities, and improving their access to sexual and reproductive health. Nicaragua has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in Latin America, with approximately 24% of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 having been pregnant at least once. Gender-based violence, deeply rooted traditional practices, the lack of comprehensive education on sexual and reproductive health, adolescent-friendly health services, and economic opportunities, all contribute to high early pregnancy rates.  Project activities include: (1) facilitating access to comprehensive sexuality education, and quality sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents; (2) implementing a communication for development strategy on the promotion of values and prevention of gender-based violence; (3) promoting curricular adjustments that allow pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers to continue their studies in an inclusive and respectful environment; (4) strengthening care and protection services to adolescent girl survivors of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, with a rights approach; (5) designing a strategy of empowerment and life skills for vulnerable adolescents, including the entrepreneurial capacities of adolescent girl survivors of sexual violence; and (6) strengthening inter-agency coordination for comprehensive attention to adolescent girls and boys.  The project is implemented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Nicaragua, in collaboration with local stakeholders public and private, including state institutions, community leaders, school-parents associations, civil society organizations, etc.</description>

    <title>COVID-19 Response Basket Fund in Nigeria</title>
    <description>The project aims to support Nigeria’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring optimum care of the confirmed cases, containing further spread of the outbreak, and establishing a pathway for rapid recovery and resilience. The project aligns with and supports the rapid implementation of the Government of Nigeria’s national COVID-19 multi-sectoral pandemic response plan, and enables a coordinated approach for the international community and United Nations’ (UN) agencies to provide targeted and coordinated support.  Project activities include: (1) increasing access for health facilities to critical medical supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE), testing kits, and treatment facility materials; (2) supporting vulnerable households with cash transfers and livelihoods opportunities; (3) raising awareness on sexual and gender-based violence prevention; (4) providing support to health facilities, including for the continuation of reproductive and maternal health care; and (5) strengthening the coordinated COVID-19 response plan of the states and federal government.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcome for this project is that the rapid implementation of Nigeria’s National COVID-19 multi-sectoral pandemic response plan is strengthened. This is to be achieved by: (1) improving rapid procurement of disease commodity packages for surveillance, prevention and control, and clinical management; (2) supporting complementary ongoing risk communication strategies for sustained community engagement and cooperation; (3) supporting the development of tailored and decentralized response strategies at the state-level and aligned to the coordinated framework at the Federal level; (4) maintaining access to essential health services; (5) enhancing pro-active, gender-responsive early recovery, social protection and cohesion and gender-based-violence response, including with vulnerable groups; (6) improving coordination of partnerships and mobilization of resources for collective response.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the project (March 2023) include: (1) 5,784 individuals (51% women) benefited from financial inclusion that focused on empowering women and improving gender equality; (2) implemented the Nigeria Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) study. The MPI findings offer insights into the level of poverty experienced by vulnerable populations in Nigeria, and this report will ultimately inform social reforms and policies for immediate to long-term actions; (3) educated 18,522 women and girls on COVID-19 prevention messages that incorporated information on gender-based violence and sexual reproductive health services; and (4) distributed 13,250 dignity kits and 3,000 menstrual hygiene kits.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>No to Gender-Based Violence in Sri Lanka</title>
    <description>This project aims to combat sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and promote gender equality in the Batticaloa, Hambantota and Kilinochchi districts of Sri Lanka. This project works to strengthen women's groups and youth groups, to help their members prevent SGBV, support victims, and extend their outreach and impact to others in their district. This project also aims to harness the imagination and energy of youth to find their own innovative ways of combating SGBV and promoting gender equality, through messages delivered by means of the arts, and social media campaigns. Project activities include: (1) providing values-changing training in SGBV and organizational management to local women’s groups and youth groups; (2) supporting youth developed anti-SGBV arts and social media messaging; and (3) providing training to village, divisional and district level government to enhance the cooperation between civil society and local government.</description>

    <title>Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods for Women Program</title>
    <description>The project aims to improve climate resilience, land productivity and carbon storage while increasing access to diversified livelihood activities in selected rural watersheds for smallholder farmers with a particular focus on women farmers.  The project creates economic opportunities for women smallholder farmers and addresses land tenure issues—particularly for disadvantaged women. In addition, it seeks to enhance the resilience of communities to tackle climate change and its negative impacts in the future by adopting sustainable land management practices. The project reduces the impacts of land degradation, improves agricultural productivity and ultimately contributes to greater food security for vulnerable households across Ethiopia.  Project activities include: (1) building green infrastructure and resiliency by designing and operating livelihood options for male and female farmers (2) investing in institutions and information for resilience building; (3) administering land and using technologies properly; and (4) managing projects and reporting on time.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved resilience of vulnerable women and men smallholder farmers to the effects of climate change; (2) enhanced land tenure security of smallholder famers—particularly for disadvantaged women and women’s groups; (3) increased economic empowerment of men and women smallholder farmers—primarily through climate-smart local enterprise development; and (4) improved food security, livelihoods and economic wellbeing of women and men smallholder farmers.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of June 2021 include: (1) 431,023 farmers, of whom 212,613 are women, adopted sustainable land management practices. They acquired 226 micro watersheds which is 144,991 hectares of land that is treated and farmed; (2) 97,304 households, including 71,979 women, were issued second-level land certificates that  update existing land records and improve tenure security of smallholder farmers; (3) cumulatively, 196,073 farmers (40% women) participated in income-generating activities supported by the project. These activities included petty trading, fattening of cattle and small ruminant, poultry farming, honey production, and small ruminant rearing. All of which provide time for degraded land to recover while families are able to continue to generate income and develop alternative livelihood options; and (4) 12,650 women farmers (43%) participated and benefited from different forms of income-generating activities: poultry farming, petty trading, beekeeping, fruits and vegetable growing in their backyards.</resultsAchieved>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: 1) strengthened organizational management for institutions providing vocational, technical and university training for jobs in construction and public works, and the tourism, hotel industry, food services industries, as well as support to help young people start businesses—that is, strengthened organizational management that incorporates approaches based on equality between men and women, as well as on the environment and sustainable development; (2) increased implementation of revised vocational, technical and university training programs that incorporate the environment, sustainable development, and equality between men and women, and meet various labour market requirements in the fields concerned; and (3) increased long-term collaboration between institutions providing vocational, technical and university training and private sector and civil society organizations for the purposes of setting up institutional services on an egalitarian basis to help young people enter the labour market and/or provide support to help them start businesses.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (July 2024) include: (1) improved management of 9 vocational, technical, and university institutions by integrating gender equality, environmental sustainability, and sustainable development measures; (2) aligned training programs with a competency-based approach. 90% of program specialists developed or revised programs using this method, surpassing the 70% target; (3) improved employment services and entrepreneurship support through collaboration between schools, the private sector, and civil society. As a result, 46 young people (32 women) initiated 30 business creation projects, far exceeding the original goal of 10 projects (4 led by women, 6 by men); (4) supported 4,826 youth (41% women) to complete training, surpassing the target of 2,500. Among them, 2,916 secured employment; (5) facilitated integrating 267 out-of-school youth into (24% women) formal vocational training programs and provided them with professional qualifications for jobs in construction, public works, tourism, hotel, and food services industries; and (6) provided scholarships to 6 women and 2 men to pursue master’s studies at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres).</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Strengthen Food Security Coordination - FAO 2019</title>
    <description>January 2019 - Palestinians face a long-term humanitarian crisis, with approximately 1 in 2 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza requiring some form of humanitarian assistance. The impacts on vulnerable Palestinians include limited access to safe water and sanitation, persistent food and income insecurity, and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  With GAC’s support, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) supports the food security sector coordination platform to ensure the effective coordination of food security-related interventions pursued by national and international organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. Project activities include: (1) engaging food security actors in sharing information on planning, priorities and findings, and assessing gaps and areas of duplication; (2) building the capacity of organizations working in the food security sector in implementing gender-sensitive programming by providing these organizations with training, technical advice and analyses on gender-related issues in food security; (3) contributing to inter-sectorial coordination by identifying needs and response modalities that may require harmonized inter-cluster responses; and (4) rolling out the resilience marking exercise for the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan for the West Bank and Gaza.</description>

    <title>Global Emergency Nutrition Program - Action Against Hunger 2021-2023</title>
    <description>January 2021, approximately 235 million people worldwide will need humanitarian assistance and protection due in part to ongoing conflicts, natural disasters and recent disease outbreaks. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated the needs globally and placed further strain on an already stretched humanitarian system. In response to the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs, GAC’s humanitarian assistance provides predictable, multi-year, multi-country support to longstanding partners to deliver quality programming in protracted humanitarian contexts globally.  With GAC’s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) provides lifesaving assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 2,000,000 crisis-affected people in multiple countries across the globe for three years. This project focuses on improving the nutritional status of vulnerable populations through delivering emergency nutrition and complementary health and water, sanitation and hygiene services. Project activities include: (1) providing treatment of severe acute malnutrition for girls and boys under the age of five and women of reproductive age; (2) providing gender-sensitive health support for women, girls and boys, such as access to baby and child-friendly spaces and gender-based violence referral pathways; (3) providing gender-sensitive water, sanitation and hygiene services at the community level and in health facilities; (4) providing sexual reproductive health and rights services and support for the decision-making role of women; and (5) providing mental health gender-based violence-related support for women, girls, men and boys.</description>

    <title>Every Child Thrives - Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <description>This project aims to ensure that marginalized and vulnerable groups in Kenya, particularly children under the age of five, have the resources to access nutrition and health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project responds to the threat of COVID-19 by supporting and strengthen the capacity of the local health system, to deliver essential nutrition and health services in five targeted counties in Kenya: Kilifi, Kwale, Siaya, Taita Taveta and Uasin Gishu.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the local health care system by training community health workers and volunteers in COVID-19 prevention, nutrition, maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition (MNCHN) and gender equality; (2) engaging with community leaders and groups to increase knowledge and support for MNCHN services and gender equality; (3) identifying gender-based barriers and risk factors to assist community health workers with providing tailored health and nutrition services to vulnerable women and girls, including survivors of sexual and gender-based violence; and (4) strengthening coordination forums for health and nutrition and COVID-19 response by providing technical and logistical assistance to targeted counties in Kenya.  This project expects to reach 768,011 children under the age of five, providing 614,000 of these children with Vitamin A supplementation and de-worming. This project should also reach 429,800 indirect beneficiaries.This project aims to adapt to service delivery to protect both health workers and the population from COVID-19, remove barriers to health services and promote the adoption of optimal nutrition practices by women, men, and children during the COVID-19 pandemic across the five targeted counties in Kenya.  This project also works in partnership with Helen Keller International.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Midwifery Services in South Sudan - Phase II</title>
    <description>In 2020, the Strengthening Midwifery Services in South Sudan - Phase II project received an increase of $4.2 million. These additional funds will ensure that the original project's objectives are achieved while adapting to the changing context in South Sudan. The Strengthening Midwifery Services II project aims to increase skilled healthcare providers' availability, especially midwives, to increase access to sexual and reproductive health services and decrease maternal and infant mortality in South Sudan. By building on Phase I, this project aims to ensure that all midwifery, nursing, and other medical students currently enrolled in training programs can successfully complete their studies and enter the workforce to save mothers and babies' lives.  Project activities include: (1) developing a new curriculum for nurses and clinical officers; (2) obtaining the equipment required and improving the ability of the faculty members and administrative staff at the training institutes to teach and manage the midwifery and nursing programs; (3) mentoring students and health care providers by international and national UN volunteer midwives during clinical practice to ensure the application of their skills; (3) training given by doctors working in health facilities to encourage a team approach in the provisions of midwifery and obstetric services; and (4) improving the ability of the Ministry of Health to manage and regulate the education of midwives and the ability of South Sudan's national and state-level Nursing and Midwifery Associations to advocate and promote their professions. The project works in partnership with the Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM), which provides direct peer-to-peer mentoring support and technical expertise from practicing Canadian midwives and midwifery educators.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Quality Education for Children in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This component of a larger project contributes additional funding to help to mitigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as nationwide school closures have interrupted education for more than 39.9 million children in Bangladesh since March 16, 2020. This project aims to improve learning for pre-primary, primary-aged and out-of-school girls and boys in the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh through gender-equitable quality education. The additional funds support the safe reopening of more than 657 primary schools and 800 Learning Centers (LC), allowing over 376,271 children (50% of which are girls) in Cox’s Bazar district, including 64,000 Rohingya refugee children and 312,271 Bangladeshi children from the host community to continue their education. Activities for this component include: (1) undertaking schools and LCs’ rehabilitation and disinfection and restocking them of learning and sanitation supplies to ensure children’s return to safe and protective learning environments; (2) strengthening partners’ engagement to ensure children’s protection in their learning environments and access to psychosocial services through School and Learning Management Committee and other referral services; and (3) providing support to School and Learning Management Committee to ensure an adequate number of teachers are available, especially in the Rohingya refugee camps.</description>

    <title>Contributing to reduced weapons proliferation and promoting peaceful societies in the Sahel</title>
    <description>This project aims to address the proliferation of small arms, light weapons and ammunition in the Sahel region that fuels armed violence, which in turn creates further demand for Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). This project proposes an innovative two-faceted approach that complements previous and ongoing arms management activities funded by PSOPs and other donors to address this complex problem. Firstly, this approach mitigates the risk of diversion of state-held weapons and ammunition in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Secondly, it addresses the impact of SALW on communities in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger by increasing knowledge of safe behaviour related to the threats of improvised landmines and explosive ordnance and identifying alternative sources of revenue for producers of handmade weapons.  Mines Advisory Group works to improve stakeholders' abilities to include gender considerations and gender-sensitive initiatives in ammunition and weapons management activities. It seeks to understand SALW impact on communities through a gendered lens.  Project activities include: (1) providing training and technical support for the destruction and disabling of weapons and ammunition; (2) increasing waste management of ammunition remnants; (3) providing technical support for the marking of weapons; (4) conducting a feasibility study on weapons tracing; (5) mitigating threats of explosive ordnance through education; (5) integrating gender considerations in arms management; (6) advocating for a national policy on the management of seized weapons; and (7) identifying alternate sources of income for artisanal weapons producers.</description>

    <title>Support to the MINUSMA Trust Fund for Peace and Security in Mali</title>
    <description>Canada’s contribution to the Trust Fund aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement and the restoration of state authority in northern Mali. It also aims to strengthen social cohesion with the goal of reducing inter  and intra community tensions, improving the protection of civilians and contributing to security in northern and central Mali. The Trust Fund for Peace and Security in Mali provides support to Malian-led efforts to resolve the crisis and supports the implementation of the Algiers Peace Process signed in July 2015 by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Progress in implementing the key provisions of the Algiers Agreement has been slow, in particular due to ongoing insecurity and armed resistance. The ongoing instability in Mali has significant impacts on the entire Sahel region.</description>

    <title>Improve Conflict Prevention and Security Governance in Burkina Faso</title>
    <description>This project seeks to improve stability and security at the community level in the East, Centre Nord and Boucle de Mouhoun regions of Burkina Faso, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project reinforces the key role of security governance mechanisms, particularly the role of traditional and community structures, as well as the role of women and youths, in strengthening social cohesion and resilience in the face of security and health crises. Project activities include: (1) conducting a participative action-research process to better understand the dynamics between the various security mechanisms and the communities, the obstacles, and the opportunities to improve conflict management and prevention and to better protect the population of Burkina Faso; (2) engaging the relevant local stakeholders from communities, authorities and security mechanisms (state, customary, informal) in the chosen regions to build their capacity to manage and prevent conflicts and protect the population; (3) encouraging decision makers to adopt a “conflict sensitivity” approach, integrate gender and youth considerations, and take into account the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on security dynamics; and (4) using awareness and training activities to facilitate the inclusion of women and gender perspectives when developing and implementing conflict prevention, security management and population protection activities.</description>

    <title>Foundations for Peace in the Artisanal Gold Mining Sector in Burkina Faso</title>
    <description>This project aims to enhance the ability of men and women in the artisanal and small-scale gold mining sector in Burkina Faso to integrate into the legal gold trade, thereby better contributing to the stability and security of their communities. This project increases the financial autonomy and economic resilience of women and men in artisanal mining communities. It reduces their vulnerability to extortion by those who provide exploitative loans or investments in exchange for gold sales with conditions that are typically wildly unfavourable to miners. The project supports capacity building for authorities, the private sector and civil society, linked to proven techniques to incentivize legal trade, while improving their enforcement strategies to hinder and marginalize the worst offenders of illicit trade.  Project activities include: (1) creating savings and loans associations; (2) capacity-building on formalized savings and loans system; (3) developing action plans with authorities and the private sector to incentivize legal and legitimate artisanal gold trading practices; and (4) conducting assessments and building capacity of authorities, the private sector and civil society to counter gold-related crimes with due consideration of gender implications.</description>

    <title>Advancing National Adaptation Planning in Developing Countries</title>
    <description>This project is a part of a multi-donor, global initiative that aims to reduce vulnerability to climate change for women and men, by improving the quality and integration of gender equality into national adaptation planning and action (a process that facilitates the integration of climate change adaptation into relevant new and existing policies) in developing countries. Projects activities include: (1) providing long and short-term in-country technical assistance; (2) facilitating peer-learning events between government policy-makers; and (3) developing and disseminating knowledge development and policy analysis. The project also works to improve the capacity of government actors and other stakeholders, particularly in small island developing states and in Sub-Saharan Africa.</description>

    <title>Emergency WASH, Food Security and Livelihood Response in Yemen - 2021-2023</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Yemen currently faces the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with over 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict and collapsing economy have pushed over 16 million people to suffer from acute food insecurity, and over 3.6 million people have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis in 2015. Essential service provisions collapsed, including critical water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and health services, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue fever and diphtheria. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to essential services and face an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence due to the crisis.  With GAC’s support, this project provides a multi-sectoral response targeting an estimated 35,868 people in the Al-Dhale'e and Dhamar governorates. Project activities include: (1) improving gender-responsive water, sanitation and hygiene services and facilities; (2) providing emergency cash assistance and non-food items, (3) increasing access to safe drinking water.</description>

    <title>Strategic Interventions to Build Momentum on SRHR - Response to COVID-19</title>
    <description>This project will enable Inter Pares to conduct activities to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in El Salvador and Bangladesh over an 18-month period. The response focuses on strengthening Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) knowledge and advocacy, services and support. Local partners, Colectiva Feminista and Nijera Kori, will conduct online campaigns to raise awareness about the increased risk of sexual gender-based violence (SGBV), teenage pregnancies, and marital rape due to the conditions arising from the pandemic, and they will undertake research on the impact of COVID-19 on women, SRHR and the LGTBI+ population.  Project activities include:(1) strengthening youth group SRHR knowledge and advocacy through interactive activities, including artistic workshops that will allow them to recognize and defend their sexual and reproductive rights; (2) increasing phone support lines in two new regions in El Salvador to provide women and adolescents with SRHR/SGBV information and counselling; (3) establishing adolescent-friendly spaces in Nijera Kori sub-centres in Bangladesh to allow adolescents to learn and discuss SRHR/SGBV topics, show films, and learn about protecting themselves on social media – all while following COVID-19 health protocols; (4) undertaking an online campaign to raise awareness about the increased risk of SGBV and teenage pregnancies due to the conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic; and (5) completing research and a report on the issue of SGBV and marital rape in Bangladesh.  This project expects to reach 2,330 people in Bangladesh and over 4,000 people in El Salvador. An additional 20,000 people will receive SRHR and SGBV violence information through online campaigns, and 49,300 family and community members will benefit indirectly from all of these activities.</description>

    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of the end of the COVID-19 project (December 2022) include: (1) established 31 adolescent-friendly spaces in targeted areas in Bangladesh. These spaces contain small libraries and are used to discuss sexual and reproductive health and rights and sexual and gender-based violence topics, and meetings for members of the Sexual Harassment and Child Marriage Prevention committees; (2) increased adolescent awareness of and access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services in El Salvador. This is through eight sexual and reproductive health campaigns; (3) Colectiva Feminista, the local partner in El Salvador, established and supported 15 groups of adolescents through interactive activities, including artistic workshops on recognizing and defending sexual and reproductive rights; and (4) assisted 254 women and adolescents on sexual and gender-based violence cases by providing legal aid, psychosocial counselling, and accompaniment over the entire COVID-19 funding period.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Syria Crisis – Emergency Health and Protection in Lebanon – INTERSOS 2021</title>
    <description>March 2021 - Lebanon is facing multiple compounding crises in 2021 including COVID-19, economic decline and political fragility, the impact of the August 2020 Beirut Port explosions and the ongoing refugee crisis. With the Syria crisis in its tenth year, Lebanon continues to host over an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide. Protection issues remain a concern, and humanitarian needs outpace available international assistance, with over 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon currently living below the poverty line.  With GAC’s support, INTERSOS provides emergency health and protection services to refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing specialized sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and gender-based violence (GBV) services to crisis-affected people, including LGBTIQ; (2) providing technical assistance on SRHR and GBV to health and protection workers and community health volunteers; (3) providing emergency cash grants for especially vulnerable cases; (4) conducting engagement sessions with women, girls, men and boys on SRHR and GBV services at the community level.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthened efficiency of state security agencies in Cambodia, Laos, and Philippines to manage nuclear and radiological security threats, especially as it relates to the illicit trafficking of related material; and (2) improved regional coordination and information sharing mechanisms in Southeast Asia.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (June 2024) include: (1) developed training curriculums and trained 37 officials from state security agencies in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Philippines. The provided training focused on individual country assessment reports that identified gaps and capacities; (2) delivered 6 train-the-trainer sessions, creating a team of 30 national trainers to ensure sustainable learning; (3) held 2 peer-to-peer regional workshops for 20 participants. This allowed to foster cooperation and information sharing related to investigations of the illicit trafficking of radioactive material in Southeast Asia; and (4) held 1 final regional tabletop exercise for 18 nuclear security practitioners. This resulted in producing a report containing a roadmap analyzing current information sharing mechanisms and recommended actions to strengthen regional cooperation.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Mobilizing Parliamentarians for Global Action in Support of the ATT</title>
    <description>This project aims to enhance the universalization and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) by strengthening parliamentary action on legislation, oversight and awareness-raising. This is achieved through direct engagement with parliamentarians by the Parliamentary Forum on Small Arms and Light Weapons to support the shaping of national legislative policies related to national obligations under the ATT. This project also provides policy tools to contribute to parliamentarians’ individual capacity, parliaments’ capacity, and a space for parliamentarians to meet and join forces with other stakeholders. Project activities include: (1) conducting three regional seminars in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East on universalization and implementation of the ATT; (2) conducting one international seminar on specific policy recommendations for action on the ATT; (3) delivering seminars and outreach activities on raising awareness and knowledge of gender equality perspectives and linkages between the ATT and the Women Peace and Security (WPS) agenda; and (4) conducting an international side event at the Conference of States Parties to the ATT on the role of parliaments and parliamentarians, particularly female parliamentarians, in advancing and advocating for the universalization and implementation of the ATT and its links to the WPS agenda.</description>

    <title>Reduce Intercommunal Violence and Reinforce Social Cohesion in Burkina Faso</title>
    <description>This project seeks to reduce intercommunal violence and reinforce social cohesion in Burkina Faso’s Centre-Nord and Sahel regions. To reduce the immediate risk of violence and better protect populations, the project identifies and supports young men and women leaders from communities in conflict to develop and implement community protection plans in collaboration with formal and informal authorities and security actors. The project also seeks to operationalize the Burkinabe government’s formal conflict prevention and management structures so they can de escalate intercommunal tensions and reinforce social cohesion in cooperation with the young leaders. Project activities include: (1) creating citizen forums; (2) analyzing factors of violence, mapping risks and drafting protection plans; (3) facilitating mediation, community dialogues, participatory theatre and solidarity initiatives; (4) providing training on leadership and conflict transformation, and revitalizing conflict prevention and management observatories; and (5) supporting the implementation of the action plans. This 18 month project was developed by Search for Common Ground. The project seeks to provide immediate responses to reduce community violence and protect civilians, while helping to reinforce social cohesion and address the root causes of conflicts.</description>

    <title>Support of Natural Resources Governance and Peacebuilding in Mali</title>
    <description>This project with Alert International focuses on peacebuilding and aims to improve natural resources governance to restore social cohesion by promoting local conflict resolution initiatives in the Koulikoro, Mopti, Ségou, Sikasso and Tombouctou regions of Mali. The initiative is based on the principle that building capacities, coupled with facilitation, and enhancing communities’ understanding of statutory instruments, primarily the legal framework for land governance, is critical and will inevitably help improve the target communities’ resilience to climate and environmental shocks with a view to efficient natural resources governance.  Project activities include: (1) providing communities with guidance on identifying, developing and implementing local peace initiatives focused on natural resources governance; (2) ensuring broad awareness of land statutes and regulations in Mali; (3) providing support to build the capacities of community forums and village/commune land commissions regarding the provisions of the land code, conflict analysis, gender sensitivity and conflict sensitivity, advocacy, and how the effects of climate change make conflicts worse; and (4) organizing a national forum to capitalize on best practices in land governance and natural resources management. These activities will bring together representatives of commune, village and local land commissions, legal authorities and court officers, and state technical services.</description>

    <title>From incarceration to reintegration: Women and minors incarcerated in Haiti</title>
    <description>This project aims to create favourable conditions for the successful reintegration of incarcerated women and minors in Haiti after they are released. The project also seeks to combat recidivism, reduce violence and prevent social destabilization in Haiti. The targeted groups in custody are minor boys, girls and approximately 200 women, in addition to officers from the penitentiary administration division. The project uses a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation, meaning a psychosocial approach that will allow beneficiaries to take advantage of socio-educational activities and participate in training activities while incarcerated.  The project centres on 2 strategic priorities: re educating and reintegrating incarcerated women and minors, and building the capacities of the penitentiary administration division.</description>

    <title>Female Leadership Program for Inclusive Security Governance in the Sahel</title>
    <description>This project seeks to strengthen a pool of existing regional female experts made up of 30 women from women’s organizations that are members and partners of the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP), the project’s partner, in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, by sharing knowledge and adapted tools on Security Sector Reform (SSR) with them. This knowledge gets passed on at the community level, giving civil society organizations a stronger voice and enhancing communities’ access to information about SSR processes. At the same time, the activity will enable this pool to network with national security institutions, enhancing its contributions and leading to positive changes in attitudes about more inclusive governance of security.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Emergency Humanitarian Assistance – ICRC 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Ukraine, an estimated 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Access to essential services is severely hindered, particularly across the “contact line” in the country’s east. The shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic added pressure on a weakened health-care system while the provision of social services struggled. Protection remains a key concern with significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence and promotes respect for international humanitarian law in Ukraine. Project activities include: (1) providing medical care, access to water and sanitation facilities, food assistance and livelihoods support; (2) providing the Ukrainian Red Cross Society with technical expertise to strengthen its capacity to promote international humanitarian law, restore family links, and deliver relief in armed conflict and violent situations; and (3) ensuring respect for international humanitarian law in the treatment of civilians not participating in hostilities, and detainees.</description>

    <title>Addressing Gaps in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Egypt</title>
    <description>The project aims to empower women and engage men by increasing the awareness of, access to and quality of, family planning services in Egypt. Egypt’s population has dramatically increased in the last decade, reaching almost 100 million people in 2018. Access to quality family planning services is critical for women and adolescent girls to lead healthy lives, and is part of an important strategy to address high population growth rates. The project also aims to address the barriers women, adolescent girls and girls face in accessing quality health services including social norms, behaviours and attitudes.  Project activities include: (1) procuring contraceptives and developing a distribution plan in targeted areas; (2) designing and rolling out of a comprehensive curriculum for population and family planning education; and (3) organizing advocacy events to solidify the national commitment for family planning.  The project is part of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) national program, which aims to reach 5,500 family planning clinics, 14,000 Ministry of Health and Population outreach workers, 2,500 women’s health clubs and 60 million people through a comprehensive media campaign on population and family planning.</description>

    <title>International Aid Transparency Initiative - Institutional Support 2020-2023</title>
    <description>This grant is Canada's institutional support to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which aims to make information about spending on international aid easier to access, use and understand. Donor countries, developing country governments and non-governmental organizations who have signed on to IATI commit to publishing more timely, comprehensive, and forward-looking information on international development assistance. IATI has developed a common, open, international standard for publishing this information.  This grant supports the IATI Secretariat, which maintains the IATI Registry, website and tools; facilitates technical discussions related to the IATI standard, data publication and use; assesses progress on open aid data; and provides technical support to publishers and users.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes as stated in the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)  include: (1) an increased publication and use of high-quality data on international development assistance in support of sustainable development; (2) an increase in the number of organizations publishing aid data in accordance with IATI standard; (3) an increase in the use of IATI data by development actors; and (4) improvement in the quality and timeliness of IATI data.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of December 2022 include: (1) The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) continues to increase data availability, use and membership. As reported in its 2022 Annual Report, the number of data publishers grew by 9% over 2021, with 1,528 organizations publishing data on their development and humanitarian activities. This data increasingly specifies whether the activities contribute to specific issues such as the Sustainable Development Goals, COVID-19, gender equality or climate action; (2) IATI launched a free publishing tool and associated guidance, which enables smaller organizations to publish quality data at no cost; and (3) IATI expanded its web-based tools and created new training material to increase the quality of data and facilitate its use. It continued to focus on the needs of partner country stakeholders by expanding the Country Development Finance Data platform further, making tools available in several languages, delivering training to in Rwanda, Nigeria and Thailand to 158 people (from governments and civil society), and publishing examples of analysis performed with IATI data.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Eradicating Polio in Pakistan</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to the interruption of wild polio and vaccine-derived polio throughout Pakistan and address gender barriers to immunization to ensure all girls and boys receive the polio vaccine. Pakistan is one of the last two remaining polio endemic countries in the world (Afghanistan is the other), where the wild poliomyelitis (polio) virus continues to threaten the health and well-being of girls and boys. This project expands immunization in rural, remote and high-risk areas in Pakistan and enhances transmission detection. The project also aims to improve health and nutrition services and outcomes for women and children.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the capacity of the polio program to immunize all girls and boys in rural and remote areas in Pakistan; (2) deploying special vaccination strategies for mobile and refugee populations in difficult to access locations; (3) engaging with communities on integrated health services (including maternal and child health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene and essential immunization); and (4) maintaining polio surveillance and detection systems by testing sanitation points and strengthening community-based surveillance networks.  The project is implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).</description>

    <title>Eradicating Polio in Pakistan</title>
    <description>This project aims to contribute to the interruption of wild polio and vaccine-derived polio throughout Pakistan and address gender barriers to immunization to ensure all girls and boys receive the polio vaccine. Pakistan is one of the last two remaining polio endemic countries in the world (Afghanistan is the other), where the wild poliomyelitis (polio) virus continues to threaten the health and well-being of girls and boys. This project expands immunization in rural, remote and high-risk areas in Pakistan and enhances transmission detection. The project also aims to improve health and nutrition services and outcomes for women and children.  Project activities include: (1) strengthening the capacity of the polio program to immunize all girls and boys in rural and remote areas in Pakistan; (2) deploying special vaccination strategies for mobile and refugee populations in difficult to access locations; (3) engaging with communities on integrated health services (including maternal and child health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene and essential immunization); and (4) maintaining polio surveillance and detection systems by testing sanitation points and strengthening community-based surveillance networks.  The project is implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).</description>

    <title>Democracy and Empowered Women</title>
    <description>The project’s goal is to enhance inclusive democratic processes for the advancement of women’s rights and at risk population, such as minorities and transgender communities in Pakistan. The project also aims to change the patterns of women's political and civic participation through changes in behaviors, practices and performance of key institutions to promote the participation of disenfranchised people (whose right to vote was removed) in community development, local governance and mainstream political decision-making processes.  Project activities include: (1) providing training to women and youth for leadership in community and local government; (2) conducting voter education training sessions for women and youth groups, and for chapters of Awaz-e-Niswan (AAN), a membership-based network of women voters across the country; (3) providing support for the establishment of four AAN district chapters for meaningful engagement with State actors and non-State actors; (4) providing capacity building support in gender-responsive governance to new and existing networks of women in local government in 15 districts; (5) providing technical assistance (TA) and training to media on gender-sensitive reporting skills to support women’s political participation in 15 districts, given by elected representatives; (6) providing TA to women political party workers, and key leaders and legislators (women and men) to advocate for women’s empowerment within political parties and in parliament; and (7) providing TA to set up a “Parliamentary Watch” to track progress on gender-sensitive legislation and policy actions.</description>

    <title>WE'RE Leaders</title>
    <description>The project aims to increase political empowerment and enjoyment of rights by women, particularly young women, marginalized groups, and those at risk in Pakistan. Women’s empowerment in civic and political arenas requires that they have the information, tools, material resources, confidence and mobility to be agents of decision-making and action.  Project activities include: (1) providing technical assistance (TA) to national/ provincial Commissions on the Status of Women and Human Rights to plan strategically and operationalize plans for women's rights; (2) conducting workshops for media and civil society about how to promote women’s civil and political rights by portraying women in non-stereotyped roles and as leaders and decision-makers; (3) providing training and TA for women legislators at national/provincial levels on drafting legislative and policy proposals related to increasing women's rights; (4) organizing awareness-raising campaigns to increase women’s registration as voters; (5) providing training for women to contest local elections; and (6) providing training for media and citizens groups on law and best practices that promote gender responsiveness and inclusion.</description>

    <title>Promoting Peace through Health in Central Mali</title>
    <description>This project aims to facilitate trust-building between rural communities and government representatives. This project seeks to build trust and cooperation in an area currently inaccessible to the government or NGOs due to violence and mistrust around pragmatic and shared health objectives with local communities actively engaged in the design of activities and dialogue.  Project activities include: (1) training local health professionals, community representatives and traditional networks in dialogue, mediation, gender sensitivity and conflict mitigation; (2) facilitating dialogue sessions with targeted communities, including rural communities and government representatives, on grievances, needs, the nature of violence and health priorities; (3)  developing a health package that includes a collection of public and animal health activities with communities and health actors; and (4) establishing the conditions necessary for sustained periods of calm during which access to the targeted communities is guaranteed by community representatives, including for the delivery of health packages.  This project allows government health actors, including Bamako and Mopti, to remain in the target zone of Tenenkou in the Mopti region for extended periods, which currently impossible. This project delivers services and nurtures trust between government officials and civilians. The targeted communities in 5 districts of Tenenkou are co-designing the intervention and are co-partners in securing and guaranteeing access and decreasing violence.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Clearance of Explosive Ordnance on the Armenia-controlled territory of Nagorno Karabakh</title>
    <description>This project aims to support Halo Trust to address the urgent humanitarian need for clearing explosive remnants of war (ERW) on the Armenia-controlled territory of Nagorno Karabakh following the renewed violence in late 2020. This project is part of a larger response by Canada to the mine action needs in the region. It complements another project in Nagorno Karabakh, supported by Canada and carried-out by a different partner in the Azerbaijan-controlled territory of Nagorno Karabakh. Project activities include: (1) explosive contamination surveys; (2) humanitarian clearance of unexploded ordnance from civilian areas; and (3) rapid explosive ordnance risk education of the local population, including displaced people. Promoting gender equality among local staff and opportunities for local women in the ERW clearance sector is an integral part of the project. The direct beneficiaries of clearance activities are women, girls, boys and men living in communities affected by explosive ordnance, especially in densely populated urban areas such as Martakert, Martuni, Stepanakert and the farmland surrounding Stepanakert and nearby villages. All activities carried out are in line with international mine action standards. This project aims to contribute to improved security and resilience of communities affected by explosive remnants of war, particularly vulnerable groups, including women and internally displaced persons, on the Armenia-controlled territory of Nagorno Karabakh.</description>

    <title>National Human Development Report Honduras 2021</title>
    <description>This project seeks to ensure that a gender approach is integrated into the National Human Development Report 2021 for Honduras. By supporting the integration of a gender approach, the project aims to contribute to increased equitable access to fair and gender-responsive justice institutions and public services. It also aims to contribute to support for state and non-state actors in Honduras in promoting and protecting human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls. This initiative supports the elaboration of the report by ensuring that the gender approach is comprehensively integrated into policy proposals and recommendations during its elaboration. This includes proposals related to fair and accessible gender responses from justice institutions, particularly regarding the rights of women and girls.  The National Human Development report is intended to raise awareness and to include in the government’s agenda proposals for the actions required to strengthen rights, reduce impunity and highlight the rights of vulnerable people, especially women. The report is also intended to increase civil society organizations’ capacity to demand public institutions provide justice and social services, strengthen the rule of law through gender equality and accomplish human development.</description>

    <title>Technical Assistance Partnership - Pilot Project</title>
    <description>This Technical Assistance Partnership Government of Canada pilot project with the Federal Judicial Affairs Canada aims to improve equality and enjoyment of human rights for the poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable people. It does so by contributing to the Feminist International Assistance Policy action areas on gender equality, empowering women and girls and to inclusive governance. The one-year pilot project will deploy Government of Canada judicial experts to Colombia and Mongolia for short-term technical assistance activities. Project activities include: (1) providing support to facilitate judicial input on important ground-breaking decisions affecting the interest of women and girls and other disadvantaged groups; (2) supporting the advocacy of gender equality on the bench and on judicial governance bodies. This includes fair and inclusive appointment processes to ensure the perspective of women and girls in the interpretation and enforcement of laws is made known and properly considered; (3) supporting gender-sensitive court practices, rules and procedures; and (4) providing support in the implementation of the justice system reform to have an independent, fair, effective, accountable, predictable and inclusive judicial system..</description>

    <title>Syria Crisis - Emergency Assistance for Palestinian Refugees in Syria and Lebanon - UNRWA 2020</title>
    <description>May 2020 – The humanitarian situation in Syria has continued to deteriorate as a result of the civil war in the country. According to the United Nations, an estimated 13.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 6 million internally displaced persons. Years of active conflict and displacement have resulted in severe protection risks and increased vulnerability of millions of people in Syria. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge and repeated attacks on humanitarian and medical workers continue, adding to the complexity of the humanitarian response.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) emergency response in Syria and Lebanon is contributing to meet the needs of Palestinian refugees. Project activities include: (1) providing emergency assistance, including food, healthcare, water and protection services to meet the basic needs of up to 438,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria and up to 27,700 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon; and (2) supporting up to 51,000 Palestinian refugee children in Syria and up to 4,812 in Lebanon in continuing their school education.</description>

    <title>FSO Safer Oil Tanker Salvage Operation</title>
    <description>This project seeks to prevent a catastrophic oil spill in the Red Sea. It aims to salvage and replace a decaying tanker off the coast of Yemen, near the port city of Hodeida. Production and offloading operations, suspended due to lengthy conflict in the area, prevented proper access and maintenance operations. This has resulted in the vessel decaying and loss of structural integrity. The tanker, FSO Safer, is at imminent risk of spilling, breaking apart or exploding. The UN has called on the international community to fund an emergency action plan to remove the oil from the tanker and replace the vessel. Project activities include: (1) providing ship-to-ship transfer of oil from the FSO Safer to the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC); (2) providing tank-cleaning and demucking; and (3) replacing the FSO with a floating CALM Buoy, permanently attached to a VLCC lightly modified to be an FSO.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) averting a humanitarian and environmental disaster that would impact the livelihoods and food security for millions of people in Yemen; and (2) advancing peace efforts in the region by incentivizing parties involved in the Yemen conflict to reach an agreement as part of a formal peace process.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2023) include: (1) contracted, mobilized, and deployed salvage assets to the FSO Safer site. Also transferred the oil stored in the FSO Safer tanker to the replacement very large crude carrier. They initiated a bidding process for the towing and green scrapping of the FSO Safer, provided Disaster Risk Reduction training, and established contingency plans at the local and regional levels. These measures averted an oil spill that would have had a devastating impact on the Red Sea’s biodiversity and approximately 12 million Yeminis; and (2) indirectly advanced peace efforts in Yemen by encouraging key political actors and stakeholders involved in the conflict to participate and collaborate. This is done by signing a Memoranda of Understanding with the De-Facto Authorities to address the threats posed by the Safer oil tanker and the need for a replacement. Also obtained assurances through the United Nations normal procedures to put the area around the FSO Safer in a no-strike zone.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Conflict in Ethiopia – World Vision 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 - The conflict in northern Ethiopia is well into its second year and has given rise to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. An estimated 9.4 million people in the three conflict-affected states currently require humanitarian assistance, including up to 90% of the population of the Tigray region. Displacement, disruption of livelihoods, and constraints on humanitarian access have left at least 400,000 people facing famine conditions and human rights abuses, including widespread sexual violence, have marked the conflict since its outset.  With GAC’s support, World Vision addresses the critical water, sanitation, and hygiene, and protection needs of internally displaced populations (IDPs) in Ethiopia’s conflict-affected Afar and Tigray regions. Project activities include: (1) restoring damaged water and sanitation facilities serving IDP sites and host communities; and (2) providing protection services (safe spaces for women and children, case management and psychosocial support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence) and essential non-food items to vulnerable people. The project also includes a longer-term development component, through which World Vision addresses protection, gender equality, and resilience issues by (3) providing educational opportunities for crisis-affected children, with a particular focus on girls; and (4) providing livelihood support for returnees and host communities affected by the conflict.</description>

    <title>Humanitarian Response to Conflict in Ethiopia – HelpAge 2022</title>
    <description>February 2022 –The western state of Benishangul-Gumuz in Ethiopia has been beset by intercommunal conflict and rapidly deteriorating security since, at least, 2018. Current estimates indicate that more than 500,000 people are now displaced in the region of just over 1 million. This conflict has been marked by recurring attacks on civilians, with women, children, and other vulnerable members of the community feeling the greatest impact.  With GAC’s support, HelpAge is addressing the essential humanitarian needs of vulnerable internally displaced persons, refugees, and host communities in Ethiopia’s Benishangul-Gumuz region, with a particular focus on the elderly and other people with specific needs. Project activities include: (1) providing age- and disability-specific items, such as mobility aids, raised beds and toilets; (2) providing supplementary food rations; and (3) offering in-home health and nutrition services to some of the most vulnerable members of an already highly vulnerable population.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Emergency Humanitarian Assistance – World Health Organization (WHO) 2022</title>
    <description>March 2022 – The humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorated significantly following the Russian military offensive beginning 24 February, which has resulted in over 2 million people displaced to neighbouring countries including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia, and nearly 1.5 million people internally displaced. The UN estimates that over 12 million people will need humanitarian assistance over the next three months and the UNHCR estimates that as many as 4 million people could seek refuge in neighbouring countries. On March 1, 2022, humanitarian partners issued appeals for approximately USD 2 billion to support the humanitarian response inside Ukraine over the next three months as well as the humanitarian needs of Ukrainians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. In light of the complexity of the crisis, it is anticipated that humanitarian needs will grow commensurately, which will require ongoing donor support to allow partners to scale up their humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, the World Health Organization (WHO) respond to immediate health needs. Project activities include: (1) treating the wounded, trauma-affected and others in need of health care, prioritizing emergency medical services people with disabilities, older persons, children, and other vulnerable groups; (2) providing life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, including prenatal care; and (3) containing COVID-19 through testing, vaccines, medical supplies, and bolstering public health protocols.</description>

    <title>Global Concessional Financing Facility - Venezuelan Migrants</title>
    <description>The Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) is an innovative financing mechanism designed to mobilize financial resources to support middle-income countries affected by refugee crises. Initially focused on the Middle East, as of 2019, the GCFF expanded to include countries affected by Venezuelan migration, such as Colombia, as eligible beneficiaries. The GCFF combines grants from donor countries with loans from multilateral development banks or agencies to create concessional financing packages.  These packages contain terms that are below market rates for refugee-affected countries. This mechanism seeks to bridge the financing gap faced by these countries, allowing them to absorb better the economic and social shocks of the refugee crisis. It also assures the well-being of vulnerable populations within their borders.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased concessional development finance support provision to Venezuelan migrant hosting countries, beginning with Colombia; (2) increased number of finance projects which strengthen the resilience of the recipient country; and (3) coordinated international response to the Venezuelan migration crisis, particularly for women and girls.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved by the World Bank through the support of the Government of Canada and other international donors as of October 2022 include: (1) a global window allocation of US$135 million provided support to 5 projects and alleviate fiscal and financial pressures caused by the impact of the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees; (2) since January 2019, the Global Concessional Financing Facility  supported the country in advancing the integration of women and girls, focusing on better healthcare services, inclusive housing, and social and economic integration; and (3) the fund served as a mechanism for policy reforms, with close support from the international donor community, the United Nations and multilateral development banks.  With the support of Canada’s sponsorship to Colombia’s entry into the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) in 2019, the global window allocation of US$134.79 million in concessional financing allowed the delivery of 5 projects worth US$1.98 billion: (1) the Colombia Second Fiscal Sustainability, Competitiveness and Migration Development Financing  worth US$750M in loans with US$31.50M by GCFF, from  May 2019 to May 2020 contributed to sustaining Colombia’s efforts to regularize 260,000 Venezuelans. This also contributed to put in place a national response strategy that facilitated access to jobs and basic social services for Venezuelan migrants and refugees, and the communities that host them; (2) the Improving Quality of Healthcare Services and Efficiency in Colombia project worth US$187.6M in loans with US$37.60M by GCFF, from March 2020 to March 2023 supported the Colombian Government’s 2018 to 2022 National Development Plan. It also focused on affiliating 225,000 Venezuelans to the subsidized health insurance system, among other objectives; (3) the Resilient and Inclusive Housing project worth US$136.70M in loans, with US$21.70 by GCFF, from  May 2021 to July 2026 improved the access of quality housing for Venezuelan migrants and host communities, and the institutional strengthening to improve homes and neighborhoods; (4) the Colombia Social and Economic Integration of Migrants DPF project worth US$526.40M in loans with US$264.0 by GCFF, from November 2021 to November 2023, addressed two pillars: (a) legal and institutional basis for the protection and long-term social and economic inclusion of migrants in host areas, and (b) improved access to and quality of services for migrants; and (5) the Program to Support Policy Reforms for the Social and Economic Inclusion of the Venezuelan Migrant Population in Colombia worth US$317.59M in loans with US$17.59M by the GCFF, from November 2021 to November 2023, implemented by the Inter American Development Bank, seeks to (a) expand regularization and information management of the migrant population; (b) expand access to social services and protection against human trafficking; and (c) promote the recognition of labour competencies for the Venezuelan migration populations.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Emergency Support to WFP – Haiti – 2022</title>
    <description>November 2022 – Food insecurity is a sector of significant concern in Haiti. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, approximately 4.7 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity (IPC3), including 1.8 million in situations of acute food and livelihoods crisis (IPC4).  Also, 19,000 people facing catastrophe levels of (IPC5), a first in the country’s recent history. The current increase in insecurity is further exacerbating humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the World Food Programme (WFP) provides additional emergency food assistance to crisis-affected people in Haiti. Project activities include: (1) distributing emergency food assistance; (2) providing cash-based transfers to most vulnerable households; (3) treating moderate and acute malnutrition for children under five, including pregnant and lactating women; and (4) improving delivery of essential supplies, including for the cholera response.</description>

    <title>Haiti Crisis – emergency Response – UNFPA – 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>December 2022 – After more than 3 years without cases, Haiti reported cholera cases in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince in October 2022. In response, the UN released a Flash Appeal to address the needs of 1.4 million people in the country. As of December 15, according to the Pan American Health Organization, there are more than 14,000 suspected cholera cases in Haiti. Furthermore, this cholera resurgence is taking place in a complex operational context, with rampant insecurity, access constraints, and insufficient infrastructures to meet humanitarian needs.  With GAC’s support, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) aims to meet the safety and sexual and reproductive health needs of vulnerable women and girls in Haiti. Project activities include: (1) ensuring protection from and response to gender-based violence; (2) providing emergency obstetric care, and sexual and reproductive health services; and (3) providing health services, medication, dignity and reproductive health kits to crisis-affected people.</description>

    <description>January 2021 – The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect the lives and dignity of people affected by conflict and other situations of violence. The ICRC provides assistance and works to prevent further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. The ICRC works with local Red Cross and Red Crescent national society staff and volunteers to implement its protection and assistance programmes worldwide.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the ICRC’s 2021 humanitarian operations in Africa aim to provide protection, emergency relief and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, as well as to promote respect for international humanitarian law. This funding supports activities aimed at responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, that bolster health care and physical rehabilitation services, and help communities build their resilience to the effects of violence. Project activities include: (1) protecting and assisting people affected by conflict and violence, through providing medical care, income support, and food assistance; (2) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of civilians not taking part in hostilities, as well as for detainees; and (3) ) increasing technical, financial and material assistance to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and deliver health services.</description>

    <title>UNDP – CBPF Emergency Famine Support – 2021</title>
    <description>September 2021 - The world experienced its single largest increase in global hunger ever recorded, with approximately 160 million additional people falling deeper into hunger in 2020. Canada is partnering with the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to respond to these needs, with support from the UNDP Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office.  OCHA oversees the coordination of international humanitarian responses in partnership with national and international actors to achieve more coherent and effective humanitarian action. This grant represents Canada’s support to the UN Country-Based Pooled Funds, managed by OCHA with support from the Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.  With the support of Global Affairs Canada and other donors, OCHA fulfills its mandate in the affected regions. Project activities include: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting the assessment and prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Lebanon - Emergency Protection and WASH Support – Oxfam-Québec 2022-2023</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide. Communities throughout the country are struggling to cope with the multifaceted crisis impacting Lebanon, including dire economic conditions and political fragility. Essential services are crucially lacking with shortages of fuel, medication and electricity affecting people’s ability to meet their basic needs. As personal savings erode and needs outpace available international assistance, nine out of ten Syrians now live in extreme poverty while the vast majority of Lebanese are below the poverty line.  With GAC’s support, Oxfam-Québec is providing basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection services to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese. Project activities include: (1) providing new and rehabilitated sanitation facilities; (2) water trucking to vulnerable communities; (3) providing community hygiene volunteers with training and hygiene kits; and (4) providing case management and psychosocial support services to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence</description>

    <description>January 2021 - The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) primary mission is to help protect people’s lives and dignity affected by conflict and other violent situation. The ICRC assists and works to prevent further suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. The ICRC works with local Red Cross and Red Crescent national society staff and volunteers to implement its protection and assistance programmes worldwide.  With GAC’s support and other donors, the ICRC’s humanitarian operations in Africa aim to provide protection, emergency relief, and other essential services to people affected by armed conflict and other violent situations, and promote respect for international humanitarian law. This funding supports activities aimed at responding to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, bolstering  health care and physical rehabilitation services, and helping communities build their resilience to the effects of violence. Project activities include: (1) protecting and assisting people affected by conflict and violence by providing medical care, income support, and food assistance; (2) ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected in the treatment of detainees and civilians not taking part in hostilities; and (3) increasing technical, financial and material assistance to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and deliver health services.</description>

    <title>Justice  accountability for international crimes through an inclusive  gender-responsive approach</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen  justice and accountability for international crimes, including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), through Justice Rapid Response (JRR) by deploying experts to national and international accountability mechanisms or civil society organizations working in the justice sector.  The project focuses on deploying experts to justice and accountability mechanisms in  Colombia, Ukraine and other fragile and conflict-affected states to document and investigate international crimes, SGBV against women, men, boys, girls, (LGBTIQ+) and gender non-conforming individuals. It also focuses on crimes against and affecting children and youths. JRR  works to improve and refine standards for investigating these crimes.</description>

    <title>Support to School Health and Nutrition</title>
    <description>The project will aim to improve the health and nutrition of children in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Niger through school-based interventions. This project will expand on the original project in South Sudan and Somalia.  In response to the COVID-19 crisis and in recognition that partnerships are needed to meet the health and nutrition needs of children, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched an initiative to strengthen their partnership at the global level and on the ground. Globally, the partnership seeks to reach 35 million children in 30 fragile and low-income countries with an integrated package of school health and nutrition services. The current project seeks to support WFP’s and UNICEF’s interventions assisting the Governments of the three countries to reopen schools safely, and to incentivise the most vulnerable children, particularly girls, to return to school safely where they can receive essential health and nutrition support. As schools reopen, this project is designed to prioritize school meal programmes with innovative delivery systems that can be adapted to the COVID 19 context to ensure that households can access nutritious foods. WFP and UNICEF have developed detailed country plans in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Niger to provide an integrated suite of activities to support children’s well-being, health and nutrition. These include school feeding, take home rations, micronutrient supplementation, community sensitization, water hygiene and sanitation (WASH), and education assistance for the most vulnerable and crisis affected children.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Emergency Humanitarian Assistance – UNHCR 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Ukraine, an estimated 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Access to essential services is severely hindered, particularly across the “contact line” in the country’s east. The shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic added pressure on a weakened health-care system, while the provision of social services struggled. Protection remains a key concern with significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With the support of GAC and other donors, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides immediate assistance and international protection to internally displaced persons and other persons of concern in Ukraine. Project activities include: (1) providing shelter, clothing and other essential non-food items; (2) providing adequate water, sanitation, and health services, including in reproductive health; (3) providing opportunities for education and livelihoods support; and (4) providing protection, including against sexual and gender-based violence, and for children.</description>

    <title>Ukraine – Humanitarian aid – HelpAge Canada 2023</title>
    <description>March 2023 – Humanitarian needs in Ukraine continue to be significant. The 2023 Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO) indicates 17.7 million people require humanitarian assistance in Ukraine this year. Priority needs result largely from attacks on energy and shelter infrastructure, which hampers access to water, food, health care, transportation, telecommunications, and other essential services. The war is impacting women and men in different ways and is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities.  With GAC’s support, HelpAge Canada is supporting the most at-risk older people at home and their caregivers, older people displaced, those staying with others and those residing in social care institutions, in conflict-affected communities in east Ukraine. Project activities include: (1) providing basic social care services for home bound older women and men, including non-food items such as hygiene kits; (2) providing mobile teams to support most at-risk older people in social care institutions with protection services; (3) providing referrals and case management for older people and caregivers requiring additional protection support; (4) providing community-based protection activities, including mental health and psychosocial support; (5) providing cash for protection; and (6) distributing winterisation items to selected social care institutions.</description>

The expected ultimate outcome is lives saved, suffering alleviated, and human dignity maintained in countries experiencing humanitarian crises or acute food insecurity.</expectedResults>

    <title>Ukraine - Coordination of Humanitarian Response - OCHA 2022</title>
    <description>January 2022 – Ukraine, an estimated 2.9 million people require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with women and the elderly bearing the brunt of the ongoing hostilities. Access to essential services is severely hindered, particularly across the “contact line” in the country’s east. The shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic added pressure on a weakened health-care system while the provision of social services struggled. Protection remains a key concern with significant mine contamination and indiscriminate attacks on essential civilian infrastructure.  With the support of Canada and other donors, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) oversees the coordination of the international humanitarian response in Ukraine, in partnership with national and international actors, to achieve more coherent and effective humanitarian action. OCHA fulfills its mandate through activities that include: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting the assessment and prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>The Cooperative Model Building Inclusive and Sustainable Communities in West Africa</title>
    <description>The project supports inclusive and green growth in Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana by strengthening co operatives, with particular focus on vulnerable populations and women. It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.  The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.  Project activities include: (1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers); (2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change; (3) creating activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women; and (4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women’s active participation in decision-making bodies.</description>

    <title>Ukraine Dairy Business Development</title>
    <description>This project aims to increase the growth of small and medium-sized dairy businesses in Ukraine, particularly  led by women. It assists 10,000 dairy farmers in 4 of Ukraine’s larger dairy-producing regions (Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kherson, and Lviv) to improve the quantity and quality of the milk produced, establish more successful farm businesses, and increase their household incomes. Project activities included: (1) providing training to advisory services companies and participating farmers on business development and environmentally sound farm management; (2) providing technical assistance to two regional milk testing laboratories; (3) providing training to farmers on cooperative best practices; (4) providing equipment and technical assistance to dairy cooperatives; (5) developing a credit guarantee facility for farmers; (6) assisting local agricultural training institutions in developing new courses and curricula for effective and environmentally sustainable dairy farm management; and (7) facilitating dialogue between government and private sector partners to develop policies and programs that support the growth of dairy cooperatives and farms.  The current focus of the project’s activities is on completing the construction of a new modern dairy processing plant, which can process over 25,000 litres of raw milk per day.  The plant aims to support over 2,500 small-scale dairy farmers (1,500 women and 1,000 men) in Ukraine. This project, which represents an amendment to a pre-existing project, underscores Canada’s commitment to supporting Ukraine’s food security and building the resilience of the local dairy sector.</description>

    <title>Global Network of Women Legislators in Defence, Security and Peace Portfolios</title>
    <description>This pilot project of five months aims to enable women legislators in defence, security and peace portfolios to establish a functional network for peer support and exchange of experience. It seeks to set up a support the recently established Global Network of Women Legislators in Defence, Security, and Peace portfolios (WLID). This network acts as a functional mechanism to address barriers to increased representation and meaningful participation of elected women in conflict prevention and resolution. It serves as a platform to bolster the advancement of (WPS) National Action Plans. Project activities are primarily focused on steps to guide the creation of the WLID Secretariat and include: (1) consulting other regional and international networks to learn lessons and refine the niche of the network; (2) creating a work plan for WLID; (3) recruiting new WLID members; (4) designing and populating a secure WLID membership database; (5) developing internal and external communications plans; (6) developing concept papers for WLID activities; and (7) drafting a network membership orientation package.</description>

    <title>Afghanistan Crisis – Emergency Support – OCHA 2023</title>
    <description>February 2023 – Prior to the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was already one of the worst in the world. The recent escalation in conflict and the resulting upheaval in Afghanistan has worsened already significant humanitarian needs and further complicated an extremely challenging operational context. In 2023, an estimated 28 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to conflict, chronic food insecurity, displacement, the coronavirus (COVID-19), broad economic crisis, and climatic events.  The United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) primary mandate is to oversee the coordination of international humanitarian responses, in partnership with national and international actors, facilitating the achievement of more coherent and effective humanitarian action.  With the support of GAC and other donors, OCHA fulfills its mandate in Afghanistan. Project activities include: (1) strengthening humanitarian leadership; (2) establishing and overseeing coordination systems; (3) monitoring and reporting on humanitarian situations; (4) advocating on behalf of affected people; (5) supporting humanitarian needs assessment, the prioritization of humanitarian needs and strategic planning; (6) promoting emergency preparedness; and (7) mobilizing funding for humanitarian assistance.</description>

    <title>Building hybrid threat resilience within the Central Election Commission of Georgia</title>
    <description>This project aims to improve the enjoyment of civic rights and freedoms for rights-holders in Georgia, including meaningful and informed participation of vulnerable societies in democratic and transparent parliamentary elections. Project activities include: (1) delivering training to the Georgian Central Election Commission (CEC) on dealing with cyber-influence activities and disinformation during elections by external actors; (2) supporting development of election management risk strategies for the CEC; (3) mounting a disinformation election observation mission during the election, including policy, technical, and Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) specialists to study and assess relevant activities and impacts; and (4) tracking and monitoring results and impacts of the initiative and convening an after-action review forum in Tbilisi to synthesize the various hybrid threat lessons learned.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) improved state resilience to hybrid threats to democracy by domestic and foreign influence; (2) improved societal resilience to threats to democracy and reduced the impact of disinformation campaigns; and (3) increased effectiveness of accountability and transparency measures implemented by the global community and oversight bodies on electoral processes.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (April 2022) include: (1) the Information Protection Centre (IPC) was established by the Central Election Commission (CEC) in the lead-up to and on election day. They also created the tangible Gender Disinformation Guidelines for the CEC based on lessons learned; (2) the IPC provided an integrated, single-source entity for rapid identification of real-time election-related disinformation. This system enables the CEC’s leadership and media team to counter disinformation; (3) publicized the Gender Disinformation Guidelines which enables women in the Georgian electoral administration to benefit from the digital space while minimizing risks; and (4) implemented an Election Risk Management Tool, a software that tracks real-time physical events and online election-related disinformation during an election.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ABDJN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Ivory Coast and Liberia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ABUJA - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - ADDIS - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Djibouti and in Ethiopia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>An Integrated Food Systems Approach to Build Nutrition Security</title>
    <description>This project aims to rapidly increase the production and consumption of bio-fortified staple crops by vulnerable smallholder farming households who have the greatest need for nutrition and health. This project is an emergency response initiative designed to improve food and nutrition security, while safeguarding livelihoods to help prevent an emerging food and nutrition crises brought about by COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Specifically, the project supports nutritious, biofortified staple foods, rich in zinc, vitamin A and iron which are expected to have a significant impact strengthening immune systems to act as a first line of defense in against viruses and diseases. The project also intends to address increased access, awareness and knowledge for women, but move towards addressing gender gaps in nutritional consumption and capacities. Project activities include: (1) strengthening the capacity of public, private and community level seed multipliers and distributers to rapidly multiply high-quality biofortified seed; (2) working with public, private and community, civil society organization, and humanitarian relief partners to distribute affordable biofortified seed to vulnerable communities; and (3) pivoting promotional and awareness campaigns to non-contact/digital spaces to educate and stimulate widespread production and consumption of biofortified crops and foods, highlighting the role of micronutrients in boosting immune systems and building resilience against shocks.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) increased access to affordable bio-fortified seed for vulnerable farming households, who tend to consume the majority of their own production; improved access to nutritious foods for household members, especially women, children and adolescents, by the growing and consuming of bio-fortified staples; (2) increased access to markets for smallholder farming households and rural/semi-urban small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), along the value chains for bio-fortified seed, crops/grain, and food; and (3) strengthened capacity and economic returns for SMEs along crop value chains by providing them with a stimulus package including connectivity, financing and training, connectivity.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2022) include: (1) produced 1,158,856 metric tonnes(t) of biofortified seeds, exceeding the initial target of over 250,000 t. 66% of the farmers perceived the quality of acquired biofortified seed as good or better than conventional varieties; (2) 8,865,995 people consumed biofortified foods, exceeding the initial target of 7.8 million people; (3) 66% of small and medium-sized enterprises reported participating in the biofortified value chains increased their gross income or profit, exceeding the initial target of 60%; (4) sold 347,373 t of biofortified crops by growing households, greatly exceeding the initial target of over 50 metric tonnes; and (5) gross farmer-level sales of biofortified crops or products totalled $146,006,190, exceeding the original target of $23 million.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - AMMAN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Jordan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ASEAN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in ASEAN member countries. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - AU - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in AU member countries. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - NROBI - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, and Uganda. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - Syria/AMMAN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Syria. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Georgia’s resilience to disinformation and cyber threats</title>
    <description>This project aims to strengthen Georgia’s resilience to disinformation and cyber-attacks.  Project activities include: (1) mapping illegitimate influence activities, state and civil society responses, and assessing Georgia’s vulnerabilities; (2) developing and implementing a simulation exercise with key stakeholders and a set of recommendations on curbing influence campaigns through a multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral approach; (3) developing media and multimedia content; and (4) liaising with relevant media outlets and social media networks to disseminate information. It does so to equip stakeholders to understand, mitigate, and respond to disinformation and cyber-attacks that threaten Georgian democratic processes and human rights.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) increased informed policy and decision-making among Georgian and international policymakers to effectively address vulnerabilities in the cyber and information domain. This focuses on the gendered impacts of these threats, including consequences for women’s safety and participation in political and social life; and (2) enhanced collaboration and coordination among key stakeholders in Georgia when mitigating and responding to cyber threats used for disinformation purposes. It focuses on threats linked to disempowering women or other marginalized groups.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2022) include: (1)  86% of participants who completed the pre- and post-test surveys reported increased knowledge and understanding regarding vulnerabilities in the cyber and information domain, including gender and inclusion considerations; (2) participating stakeholders recognized that the government, civil society, and the media should encourage cooperation on technical, non-politicized issues around information warfare and information sharing and promote their mutual interest; (3) formed 30  recommendations for improving Georgia’s resilience to disinformation and cyber threats. This includes 4 recommendations that cover gender and inclusion considerations for Georgian stakeholders and their international partners; and (4) strengthened Georgian media’s crisis resilience sharing strategies for combating disinformation and lessons learnt with their Ukrainian counterparts from a roundtable with Ukrainian media and civil society representatives.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - BEJING - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in China. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - BGHDD - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Iraq. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - BGRAD - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - BNGKK - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Broadcasting for Change: Empowering Young Women Through Media in Tanzania</title>
    <description>The project aims to empower young women and girls across Tanzania to make their own decisions regarding their social, economic and political rights, by launching a new iteration of its nationally recognized youth radio show "Niambie" centered on transforming young women and men's attitudes towards women's rights and gender equality.  Project activities include weekly radio programmes, daily social media content and live community events that focus on a wide range of women’s rights issues and promoting gender equality.  From April to December 2020, the project's media interventions focused on tackling COVID-19 related  issues in Tanzania. The initiative provided the opportunity for the project team to increase their knowledge of the gender implications of COVID-19 and how that affects women and girls compared to men and boys. In the course of producing COVID-19 focused media outputs, their understanding of how a public health emergency, such as COVID-19, affects different groups in the community increased significantly. The stories documented showed how school closures, for instance, put adolescent girls in danger of different forms of sexual exploitation including rape and sexual abuse by close family members and relatives, early marriage, physical and emotional violence. This knowledge led the national and local radio station partners to produce episodes focusing on children protection, amplifying the risk children are facing and the role of individuals in ensuring children are safe at home.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BPEST - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BUCST - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Moldova. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - CLMBO - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Maldives and Sri Lanka. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - CRCAS - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Venezuela. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - DHAKA - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Bangladesh. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - GRGTN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Guyana and Suriname. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - HANOI - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Vietnam. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Support to the Polio Eradication Endgame Strategic Plan</title>
    <description>This project supports the implementation of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)’s Endgame Strategic Plan, which provides a global roadmap to eradicate polio by 2020. Project activities include: (1) working with targeted governments to strengthen oral polio vaccine campaign safety and quality and introduce inactivated polio vaccine into routine immunization systems; (2) providing technical assistance to front-line workers to increase immunization coverage; and (3) working with governments to transition polio assets and infrastructure to broader health goals and national health systems.  The GPEI is a partnership between UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</description>

    <title>Global Concessional Financing Facility - Jordan - 3</title>
    <description>The Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), established in July 2016, is an innovative financing mechanism designed to mobilize financial resources to support middle-income countries affected by refugee crises. In recognition of these countries’ global public good in hosting significant populations of refugees, the institution uses donor contributions to significantly reduce the interest rates on loans provided to host countries by partner multilateral development banks. This lower-cost financing targets projects that improve the well-being of refugees and local host communities in areas such as education, health, and job creation to create sustainable development outcomes. As one of ten supporting donors, Canada is a member of the Steering Committee for this financing mechanism.</description>

    <title>Strengthening the resilience of women's organizations in the social economy (FORTER'ESS)</title>
    <description>This project aims to promote the decent work of Tunisian women and improve the sustainability of women-led Social and Solidarity Economy Organizations (SSEOs) during the COVID-19 crisis in Tunisia. In the absence of support and assistance, these organizations, the majority of which unestablished, risk the permanent cessation of their activities due to containment measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic that have had significant economic, social and health consequences for thousands of Tunisian women and their families. Project activities include: (1) assessing the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women-led SSEOs; (2) developing resilience and development plans to support SSEO’s continuous operations; (3) designing a leadership development program for women entrepreneurs and leaders of SSEOs; (4) organizing training sessions on access to local markets, export procedures and the production of manuals on quality standards for the sectors/products targeted by SSEOs; and (5) the realization of a study and training on the integration of gender considerations in the legal texts governing SSEOs in Tunisia.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected results of this project include: (1) consolidated women-led SSEOs in disadvantaged areas of Tunisia; (2) improved workplace protection and working conditions for women entrepreneurs and SSEO workers; and (3) established an inclusive, equitable and supportive ecosystem for women SSEOs, particularly in terms of their legal framework.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved as of April 2024 include: (1) the project strengthened the organizational and financial capacities of 22 social economy organizations impacted by COVID-19 in north-west Tunisia (Béja, Jendouba and Kef governorates). A total of 850 women members of these organizations benefited from direct or indirect support; (2) 1OO women managers received training to strengthen their managerial skills. Training focused on the values and principles of the social and solidarity economy (SSE), the administrative and financial management of cooperatives, and technology and IT tools; (3) 22 social and solidarity economy (SSE) organizations took part in training courses on sales techniques, commercial prospecting, and received materials to facilitate the sale of their products (packaging); (4) 3 sales outlets in Djebba, Testour and Kef have been fitted out to facilitate the sale of products from social and solidarity economy structures; (5) social and solidarity economy (SSE) organizations members have taken part in national, regional and local fairs and events, enabling them to boost the sales momentum of the organizations benefiting from the project. These participations enable a better understanding of the market and the needs of the end customer; (6) the project accompanied 100 women to register in social protection systems, while working on networking with the responsible structures, including the Caisse nationale de sécurité sociale, Affaires sociales, Union tunisienne de l'agriculture et de la pêche and Bureau de l'artisanat for the professional card; (7) sensitized 22 social and solidarity economy (SSE) organizations to safety in the workplace, with the purchase of health and safety equipment for group premises; (8) set up training courses, including those on International labor organization (ILO) tools, Think. COOP &amp; Start.COOP and Get Ahead, in order to strengthen the capacities of institutional partners who support women entrepreneurs, such as the Bureau d'Appui à la Femme Rurale; (9) mobilized a team of experts to work with the Ministry of the economy and planning as part of an SSE commission. This collaboration led to the production of the Tunisian SSE Development plan 2023-2025, a policy note on formalizing the informal economy through SSE, integrating the gender dimension, the SSE 2035 strategic vision report, the report of the SSE 2023-2025 plan preparation commission and the implementation plan for the SSE development plan's axes for the 2023-2025 period.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Support to ODI-HPG Integrated Programme 2022-2024</title>
    <description>The ODI Humanitarian Policy Group project examines how the humanitarian sector can engage with social and political dynamics influencing humanitarian assistance through their new Integrated Programme. Through the integrated programme, the Humanitarian Policy Group seeks to explore five research projects from various angles to examine how the humanitarian sector can engage with the social and political dynamics that influence humanitarian assistance.  Project activities include: (1) designing the research approach and methodology through a comprehensive scoping and refining process; (2) producing and publishing in-depth research through literature reviews and case studies in partnership with key actors; and (3) developing final reports and recommendations and communicating findings through policy engagement with key programme and policy actors.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - HRARE - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Angola, Botswana and Zimbabwe. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ISBAD - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Pakistan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - JUBA - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in South Sudan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - KHRTM - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Eritrea and Sudan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - KNGTN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Jamaica. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - KYIV - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Ukraine. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - MANIL - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in the Philippines. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - MPUTO - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - NSLTN - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - PANAM - 2022/ to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Panama. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - PRNCE - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Haiti. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - RABAT - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Morocco and Mauritania. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ROME - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Albania. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - SDMGO - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in the Dominican Republic. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - SSAL - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in El Salvador. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - TUNIS - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Tunisia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - YNGON- 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Myanmar. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ZAGRB - 2022 to 2023</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Kosovo. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Education Cannot Wait - Institutional support 2019 to 2021</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to Education Cannot Wait (ECW). ECW uses these funds, along with other donor’s funding to achieve its mandate.  ECW is the only global fund designed to deliver rapid, flexible support to address gaps in financing, capacity and coordination to ensure that girls and boys in crisis situations have access to quality education. ECW is hosted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and is administered under UNICEF's financial, human resources and administrative rules and regulations, while operations are run by an independent ECW Secretariat.  ECW is the first global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. It was established during the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 by international humanitarian and development aid actors, along with public and private donors.  Based on the recognition that continuous access to quality learning is a priority for children and families affected by conflicts, natural disasters and displacement and that no organization can do it alone, ECW comes as a ground-breaking initiative bringing together public and private partners eager to work together differently and mobilise the funding required to deploy immediate and sustainable programmes tailor-made to the educational needs of these children.  ECW focuses on mobilizing governments, and humanitarian and development actors to raise predictable, multi-year financing, build the capacity of national and global actors, and improve coordination of education responses to crisis. ECW supports activities designed to meet education needs for crises-affected children and youth between the ages of 3 and 18.  ECW supports activities such as the provision of learning materials and psychosocial support, school and classroom equipment and infrastructure, teacher training and support as well as non-formal education programs. ECW aims to reach 8 million affected children and youth by 2021, including those with disabilities, improving their learning outcomes and enhancing their socio-emotional well-being and employability.</description>

    <title>Education Cannot Wait - Institutional support 2019 to 2022</title>
    <description>This grant represents Canada’s long-term institutional support to Education Cannot Wait (ECW). ECW uses these funds, along with other donor’s funding to achieve its mandate.  ECW is the only global fund designed to deliver rapid, flexible support to address gaps in financing, capacity and coordination to ensure that girls and boys in crisis situations have access to quality education. ECW is hosted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and is administered under UNICEF's financial, human resources and administrative rules and regulations, while operations are run by an independent ECW Secretariat.  ECW is the first global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. It was established during the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 by international humanitarian and development aid actors, along with public and private donors.  Based on the recognition that continuous access to quality learning is a priority for children and families affected by conflicts, natural disasters and displacement and that no organization can do it alone, ECW comes as a ground-breaking initiative bringing together public and private partners eager to work together differently and mobilise the funding required to deploy immediate and sustainable programmes tailor-made to the educational needs of these children.  ECW focuses on mobilizing governments, and humanitarian and development actors to raise predictable, multi-year financing, build the capacity of national and global actors, and improve coordination of education responses to crisis. ECW supports activities designed to meet education needs for crises-affected children and youth between the ages of 3 and 18.  ECW supports activities such as the provision of learning materials and psychosocial support, school and classroom equipment and infrastructure, teacher training and support as well as non-formal education programs. ECW aims to reach 8 million affected children and youth by 2021, including those with disabilities, improving their learning outcomes and enhancing their socio-emotional well-being and employability.</description>

Project activities include: (1) providing life skills sessions on healthy lifestyles, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), mental health, financial literacy and negotiation skills to existing and newly established girls' clubs and peer-to-peer groups; (2) providing financial assistance for the families of the most vulnerable adolescent girls and young women to address specific educational barriers; (3) holding training workshops for formal and non-formal teachers and school leaders on basic, gender responsive and inclusive pedagogical approaches, including providing psycho-social support; and (4) developing remote curricula for learners to use at home enhances access to education and improves the quality of home-based instruction.  With additional funding to address challenges arising from COVID-19, the project expanded its scope to work with schools and communities in promoting good health and hygiene practices. It also initiated the provision of remote learning materials, at-home instruction, and remedial classes once schools reopened.  This project benefits 123,768 adolescent girls and young women, including approximately 37% refugees or IDPs. The project aims to reach an additional 23,164 teachers (formal and non-formal), educational leaders, other education professionals, members of boys’ clubs, and community and faith leaders, 61% women.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - BDGTN - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - GTMLA - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Belize and Guatemala. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - DELHI - 2021 to 2022</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Bhutan, India and Nepal. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Capacity building of institutional actors involved in the fight against human trafficking</title>
    <description>This project seeks to strengthen the rights of human trafficking victims in Colombia, mainly women, children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) individuals, to better protect them. Project activities include: (1) delivering training workshops on effective, gender-based care for direct and indirect victims of human trafficking to government employees responsible for assisting them in Colombia; (2) providing technical support to Defensoría del Pueblo, an advocacy organization, to build its capacity to develop recommendations for improving care for human trafficking victims. It does so by tailoring care to local needs in line with applicable international standards in Colombia; and (3) delivering training workshops on strategic litigation for important human trafficking cases to government employees and lawyers representing trafficking victims in Colombia. This project benefits Colombian judicial and state actors involved in defending the victims of human trafficking, as well as the victims themselves.</description>

    <title>Accelerating action to end female genital mutilation in Ethiopia - program 2020 to 2024</title>
    <description>The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) program aims to speed up action to end female genital mutilation (FGM) under Ethiopia's National Costed Roadmap to end child marriage and FGM. UNICEF helps provide women and girls – including out-of-school girls – with the skills and knowledge required to voice their opinions and promote gender equality in decision-making at the household and community level. The project aims to engage adolescent girls in developing and implementing community-level interventions to end FGM, including establishing support networks and communication campaigns. UNICEF builds the capacities of master trainers to train and supervise community-level health workers to integrate prevention of FGM, management and referral for FGM-related complications. The project focuses on establishing community surveillance mechanisms, including through social and protection services and community leaders, to spread information about the harms of FGM, and track and intervene in cases of FGM. UNICEF performs formative research with a human-centred design and participatory approach to inform and identify effective processes in empowering women and girls and ending FGM. UNICEF disseminates best practices to tackle the root causes of FGM, including through Ethiopia’s National Alliance to End Child Marriage. The project also builds the capacity of the Government of Ethiopia to collect data and monitor progress related to its efforts to end FGM.</description>

    <title>Tracking weapon supplies to terrorist groups in Niger and Burkina Faso- phase II</title>
    <description>This project aims to reduce the illicit cross-border supply of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALWs) to armed and terrorist groups in the Sahel region. Conflict Armament Research assists Burkina Faso and Niger’s security institutions to identify, analyze, and document cross-border SALWs and other ammunition flows through those 2 countries. The project aims to improve the capacity of security institutions in Burkina Faso and Niger to collect and share data on illicit trafficking of SALWs. It also seeks to increase  awareness of illicit trafficking trends in the Sahel region. Project activities include: (1) training security personnel in Burkina Faso and Niger on documenting, identifying, analyzing, and tracing  illicit SALW; and (2) providing SAWLs documentation equipment to security institutions, including evidence tags, hard drives, and cameras.</description>

    <expectedResults>The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) enhanced monitoring and tracing of illicit SALWs recovered following attacks and seized by security institutions in Burkina Faso and Niger; and (2) increased use of data on newly emerging cross-border trafficking tendencies by security institutions in Burkina Faso and Niger. This includes strengthened evidence-based advocacy for better management of national stocks.</expectedResults>
    <resultsAchieved>Results achieved at the end of project (May 2023) include: (1) made significant progress towards reaching this outcome. This includes 38 individuals trained (35 men and 3 women) who gained an average of 2.1 out of 5 on the ability to analyze sources of illicit trafficking of weapons and ammunition was measured; Conflict Armament Research’ (CAR) Technical Support Unit developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on the ‘Safe handling and storage of explosives’ formally adopted by Burkina Faso’s Customs in 2022; in Mali, as a result of training provided under the project, the CNLPAL now conducts its own in-house training to new personnel based on CAR’s modules; and in Burkina Faso, the Chef d’État Major of the Gendarmerie inserted a module on weapon tracing in the curriculum of the Academie des sous-officers; and (2) supported CAR to provide analysis of seized weapons, ammunition, and various components. This helped shed light on the overall life cycle and, where possible, chain of custody of seized materiel and even going further as to provide technical analysis of IED incidents at the request of the Service Central de Lutte Contre le Terrorisme et la Criminalité Transfrontalière Organisée (SCLCT-CTO) in Niger and the Commission Nationale de Contrôle des Armes (CNCA) in Burkina Faso; the CAR also produced 5 technical notes for authorities in Burkina Faso, and 2 for partners in Niger on tactics used and mitigation methods for those types of attacks.</resultsAchieved>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - ACCRA - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Togo. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - LSAKA - 2018 to 2019</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Zambia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - GRGTN - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Guyana and Suriname. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - HAVAN - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cuba. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - JUBA - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in South Sudan. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - KLMPR - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Malaysia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - KNSHA - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Dem. Rep. of Congo and Congo-Brazzaville. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - MPUTO - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - NROBI - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, and Uganda. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - PRET - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - PRNCE - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Haiti. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - DSLAM - 2020 to 2021</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Comoros, Tanzania and Zambia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the six pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The six thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - SDMGO - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in the Dominican Republic. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - SSAL - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in El Salvador. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - TUNIS - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Tunisia. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - WSAW - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Belarus. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI)  - YUNDE - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad and Gabon. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>

    <title>Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) - ZAGRB - 2019 to 2020</title>
    <description>The Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) supports small projects proposed and implemented by local organizations in Kosovo. The CFLI contributes to the overall goal of reducing poverty by providing funding for small projects that offer direct social, economic or technical assistance to local populations.  The CFLI retains the same broad themes set out since 2016, which align closely with the 6 pillars of the Feminist International Assistance Policy. This allows flexibility to respond to and focus on themes relevant to local needs. The 6 thematic priorities include: (1) contributing to inclusive governance, including diversity and LGBTQ2, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; (2) contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (3) contributing to peace and security, with a focus on conflict prevention and building peace; (4) contributing to growth that works for everyone, including women’s economic rights, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, investing in the poorest and most vulnerable, and safeguarding economic gains; (5) contributing to environment and climate action, focusing on adaptation, mitigation and  water management; and (6) contributing to human dignity, covering health, education and nutrition.</description>
